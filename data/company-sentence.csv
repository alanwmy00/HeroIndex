FedEx Corp. announced today an ambitious goal to achieve carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040.

To help reach this goal, FedEx is designating more than $2 billion of initial investment in three key areas: vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration. This includes a pledge of $100 million to Yale University to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture, accelerating research into methods of carbon sequestration at scale, with an initial focus on helping to offset greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline emissions.

âWe have a responsibility to take bold action in addressing climate challenges,â said Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO, FedEx Corp. âThis goal builds on our longstanding commitment to sustainability throughout our operations, while at the same time investing in long-term, transformational solutions for FedEx and our entire industry.â

Key steps toward reaching the carbon neutral goal include:

Vehicle Electrification . By 2040, the entire FedEx parcel pickup and delivery (PUD) fleet will be zero-emission electric vehicles. This will be accomplished through phased programs to replace existing vehicles. For example, by 2025, 50% of FedEx Express global PUD vehicle purchases will be electric, rising to 100% of all purchases by 2030.

Sustainable Customer Solutions . FedEx will work with customers to offer end-to-end sustainability for their supply chains through carbon-neutral shipping offerings and sustainable packaging solutions.

Sustainable Fuels . FedEx will continue to invest in alternative fuels to reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions.

Fuel Conservation and Aircraft Modernization . FedEx will build on its successful FedEx Fuel Sense initiatives designed to reduce fuel consumption in its aircraft. Since 2012, the FedEx Fuel Sense and Aircraft Modernization programs have saved a combined 1.43 billion gallons of jet fuel and avoided over 13.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Facilities . FedEx will continue efforts to make its more than 5,000 facilities worldwide more sustainable through continued investments in efficient facilities, renewable energy, and other energy management programmes.

Natural Carbon Sequestration . FedEx funding will help to establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture to support applied research into natural carbon sequestration solutions.

The path toward sustainability requires new strategies for removing and storing Earthâs excess carbon. The Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture will catalyze interdisciplinary research across the natural sciences and engineering in an effort to accelerate this work.

Center researchers will develop methods that build on natural carbon storage systems, including biological ecosystems and the geological carbon cycle, improving, where possible, how quickly carbon can be absorbed, how much can be contained, and how long it can be stored. Through these efforts, Yale scientists aim to create a portfolio of carbon removal strategies that have impacts on a global scale.

Building upon initial successes in the aviation sector, the centre will broaden its scope to address additional global sources of emissions â publishing and sharing its findings so that businesses, industries, and governments can benefit from work that will accelerate the adoption and implementation of natural carbon capture strategies around the world.

âAddressing climate change is a complex challenge that demands urgent action, and natural carbon capture strategies will be one key part of that action,â said Dr. Ingrid C. âIndyâ Burke, the Carl W. Knobloch, Jr. Dean of the Yale School of the Environment. âThrough the creation of the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture, we aim to develop measurable carbon capture strategies to help offset carbon emissions globally.â

The FedEx commitment builds on a history of sustainable practices. Since 2009, the companyâs efforts have contributed to an approximately 40% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity across the enterprise while package volume increased 99% during that period. Recently, FedEx was ranked first in its industry on JUST Capitalâs 2021 list of âAmericaâs Most Just Companiesâ in the environment category and first in the travel, transport and logistics sector of Newsweekâs âAmericaâs Most Responsible Companies 2021.â

âWhile weâve made great strides in reducing our environmental impact, we have to do more. The long-term health of our industry is directly linked to the health of the planet, but this effort is about more than the bottom line â itâs the right thing to do,â said Mitch Jackson, Chief Sustainability Officer, FedEx Corp. âAt FedEx, we are committed to connecting people and possibilities resourcefully and responsibly. The steps we are taking today will contribute a positive impact for generations to come.â

Image Credit: Supplied

Dubai: Network International, the UAEâs home-grown international payments firm is cautiously optimistic on business outlook in 2021, but is positive on the long term structural shift of payments business in the region, Nandan Mer, CEO told Gulf News in an interview.

Mer with more than 30 years of experience in global financial services business wants innovation and agility to be the new driving forces for the regional payments leader.

As anticipated, Network reported a drop of 15.1 per cent in revenue from $335.379 million in 2019 to $284 million in 2020 and 90.2 per cent drop in net profit from $57.31 million to 5.59 million in 2020.

While COVID-19 disruptions have caused sharp declines in revenue and profit, Mer sees these as temporary blips and the company is poised for strong turnaround as regional economies recover and digital payment solutions gain traction.

Nandan Mer, CEO of Network International

âWe are fortunate to be operating in high growth and fragmented digital payments markets, where we are seeing signs of an acceleration in underlying trends and the long-term opportunity remains significant,â said Mer.

Volumes on the rise

Lockdowns, travel and movement restrictions caused a sharp decline in the total volumes processed (TPV) by the company in the first half of 2020 with encouraging signs of improvement in towards the year-end.

In 2020, the TPV declined 23.4 per cent year on year but on the brighter side the company recorded strong growth of 53 per cent in directly acquired TPV from online merchants.

âAlthough the pandemic clearly impacted our volumes [TPV] last year, the recovery trend we are witnessing is very encouraging, especially the acceleration in the move of customers away from cash to digital. This is a clear sign of future growth,â said Mer.

Mer said the changes happening in the payments behaviour, especially the massive shift away from cash to digital modes of transactions are a game changer for the payments business in the region.

âWhat we are seeing is a structural shift that will support our business, which gives us confidence in the long-term outlook,â said Mer.

The shift in consumer behaviour is supported by trends in the card data the company host on behalf of bank customers.

âIf we look at a cohort of consumers who used their cards almost exclusively at ATMs in January 2020, one year later, those consumers are now only using their card at the ATM for less than half of their transactions, with the remainder taking place at a POS [point of sales] terminal or online,â he said.

2021 outlook

Network sees some temporary headwinds to trading to linger until COVID cases subside and consumer confidence returns fully. However, for the year as a whole, the volumes are expected to return to 2019 levels.

âWe are optimistic but are not closing our eyes to the uncertainties around. Whilst the fluidity of the pandemic creates some uncertainty, we expect 2021 total revenues to return approximately to those recorded in 2019,â said Mer.

In merchant solutions, Network expects to see a sharp turnaround this year in the directly acquired domestic TPV. However, the company sees the international TPV to be about 50 per cent lower than 2019 as travel restrictions are expected to be in place for the good part of the year.

In issuer solutions the company expects to see increased new card issuance, transaction volumes and new business activity, leading to revenue exceeding 2019 levels.

A seasoned strategist at the helm Nandan Mer, the new CEO of Network International has a proven track record of building and growing businesses over 30 years in a number of global markets with leading financial institutions including American Express, Citigroup, United Bank for Africa (UBA) and most recently at MasterCard.

During his 11-year career at Mastercard, Nandan was Strategy Head for International Markets, President for the Japanese business and Head of Global Consumer Credit and Loyalty Solutions. Prior to that, Nandan was Head of UBA - International Corporate and Investment Banking. Before UBA, Nandan built and led consumer banking businesses for two decades with Citigroup in India, Czech Republic, Israel, Russia and the UK.

Long term outlook

Just about a month into the top job, Mer is clear on the strategic direction of Network, which over the years transformed itself from a captive payment processing unit of Emirates NBD to become a global payments solutions provider.

âPrimarily as a payment processor our job is to facilitate business solutions for our customers both on the acquiring side and payments side want. Going forward, we will be focused on innovation and agility to meet the expectations of our customers,â said Mer.

Mer believes the company has huge opportunities to innovate on solutions for its customers in the region.

âValue addition will be the key to our long-term growth strategy. The banks in the region, especially those in the UAE and the GCC are world class in their customer experience focus. The merchants too are truly global in their outlook. We believe, going forward our focus should be on how to add value to our direct customers and facilitate value addition for their consumers,â said Mer.

He said there are huge unexplored areas in business to business (B to B) payment solutions in the region. There are large volume players in the region who are not yet in the ambit of Networkâs business. Intra-industrial sector payment solutions remain hugely unexplored in the region. Additionally P2P is key to financial inclusion in Africa and there is room to innovate and build new payment rails.

âCreation of payment ecosystems in these sectors will be a huge growth opportunity. Going forward we will work with these sectors to create innovative and practical solutions,â he said.

In Africa, Network will be entering Sudan as a new market this year. The companyâs Africa plans got a big boost last year with the acquisition of DPO Group (DPO), an online commerce platform.

Market expansion

In 2020, the company signed four new payment processing contracts for banks across Africa; saw significant growth in online payments with over 1,600 UAE merchants signing up to its N-Genius payment gateway.

The immediate focus of market expansion in the GCC is Saudi Arabia, the largest economy in the region.

âWe intend to move forward with expansion in Saudi Arabia, and on-soil data centre deployment, as soon as practical to do so. Saudi Arabia remains an important future growth accelerator for the business and we are committed to entering this market when more normal circumstances resume,â said Mer.

In Africa, Network will be entering Sudan as a new market this year. The companyâs Africa plans got a big boost last year with the acquisition of DPO Group (DPO), an online commerce platform.

The proposed acquisition is progressing towards final regulatory approvals, which are now expected in the second quarter. DPO saw strong performance in 2020 with TPV growth of over 30 per cent year.

âDPOâs business is supported by highly attractive fundamentals, including e-commerce and mobile money exposure, and 100 per cent presence in the fastest growing payments market in the world, making it a clear growth accelerator for us,â said Mer.",,,0.96998179,0.0,positive,"Network International, UAEs home-grown international payments firm cautiously optimistic business outlook 2021, positive long term structural shift payments business region.

The Center has partnered with local agencies and businesses, including Sodexo and Second Harvest Food Bank, to implement the food recovery practices of preventing surplus food items from being sent to the landfill. The Center rescues unspoiled, healthy foods from UNCPâs dining facilities, Starbucks, Cafe 641 and Einstein Bros. Bagels, and packaged food from the local Walmart location. The food not consumed by people is recycled into animal feed or compost to aid in the regrowth of food production.

âThis process is a tremendous example of UNCPâs commitment to serving our campus community, addressing food insecurity and to living sustainably,â said Christie Poteet, director of Community and Civic Engagement.

Throughout these partnerships, the food cycle is working efficiently to serve the UNCP community. The entry of the cycle begins with food production via local farmers, then moves to distribution and consumption of food before entering the food rescue phase. Here the retrieval of unspoiled/healthy food from businesses head to food pantries, like UNCPâs on-campus CARE Resource Center.

Perfectly healthy, consumable food that would otherwise have been discarded as waste, is made available to people facing food insecurity. The next phase of the food cycle is referred to as food recycling, where any food not consumed at the pantries is sent back to local farmers as waste. The farmers then redistribute the food waste and convert it into organic compost that feeds their livestock or as compost that serves as a rich fertilizer. The CARE Resource Center is in partnership with two local farmers, Bernice Oxendine and Doug Locklear, to complete the food cycle in the redistribution phase.

âAt every phase there is food waste, but with advocacy and knowledge we can reduce the waste and in turn reduce our carbon footprint in the world,â said Deborah Gunsallus of NC Campus Compact Americorp VISTA Hunger Corps.

Another key component to this cycle is Sodexoâs partnership with New Ground Farms. While the university is buying food from the farm, it is also offering a service-learning American Indian Studies course taught by Mary Ann Jacobs, who works with the farm. Through the project, students are learning about and assisting with agricultural sustainability practices of a local Native American farmer.

Community and Civic Engagement began the food recovery process with Sodexo at UNCP in 2015. At the time, CCE joined the Food Recovery Network, where volunteers would recover food from the cafeteria location and then donate it to a local nonprofit. Because the food from this initiative was not individually packaged and would require unavailable food storage methods, it could not go directly to the on-campus food pantry. When the universityâs retail food locations began to grow, and pre-packaged food sales were expanded, Sodexo was able to partner with CCEâs CARE Resource Center to recover food that directly benefits students in need of assistance.

Similarly, CCEâs food recovery partnership with Walmart began in 2018. This component has allowed the center to exponentially expand its capacity to serve students. Student staff members pick up the donations three times a week and check items closely before stocking the CARE Resource Center.

âThe CARE Resource Center is able to directly impact the lives of students, faculty, staff and community members because of the partnerships within the food cycle,â Poteet said. âWe are incredibly thankful to be part of this system and know efforts at all levels of food distribution and consumption are vital to helping those in need,â she continued.

The Center includes an on-campus food pantry and professional clothing closet that is open to students, faculty, staff and community members. Students are welcome to visit the pantry twice a month, while faculty and staff are welcome once a month. Community members who wish to receive food services are required to attend monthly educational workshops that focus on life and career development skills. Upon completion of each workshop, participants are awarded a CARE Resource voucher to use at the pantry. Though the CARE Resource Center is housed under the Office for Community and Civic Engagement, it is primarily managed by student workers and volunteers.

During the 2019-2020 academic year, the department saw 3,196 visits to the CARE Center. In 2020-2021 there have been 1,778 visits. The reduced traffic is attributed to a lower number of students living on campus because of the pandemic.

The CARE Resource Center is in partnership with two local farmers, Bernice Oxendine and Doug Locklear, to complete the food cycle in the redistribution phase.

âAt every phase there is food waste, but with advocacy and knowledge we can reduce the waste and in turn reduce our carbon footprint in the world,â said Deborah Gunsallus of NC Campus Compact Americorp VISTA Hunger Corps.

Another key component to this cycle is Sodexoâs partnership with New Ground Farms. While the university is buying food from the farm, it is also offering a service-learning American Indian Studies course taught by Mary Ann Jacobs, who works with the farm. Through the project, students are learning about and assisting with agricultural sustainability practices of a local Native American farmer.

Community and Civic Engagement began the food recovery process with Sodexo at UNCP in 2015. At the time, CCE joined the Food Recovery Network, where volunteers would recover food from the cafeteria location and then donate it to a local nonprofit. Because the food from this initiative was not individually packaged and would require unavailable food storage methods, it could not go directly to the on-campus food pantry. When the universityâs retail food locations began to grow, and pre-packaged food sales were expanded, Sodexo was able to partner with CCEâs CARE Resource Center to recover food that directly benefits students in need of assistance.

Similarly, CCEâs food recovery partnership with Walmart began in 2018. This component has allowed the center to exponentially expand its capacity to serve students. Student staff members pick up the donations three times a week and check items closely before stocking the CARE Resource Center.

âThe CARE Resource Center is able to directly impact the lives of students, faculty, staff and community members because of the partnerships within the food cycle,â Poteet said. âWe are incredibly thankful to be part of this system and know efforts at all levels of food distribution and consumption are vital to helping those in need,â she continued.

The Center includes an on-campus food pantry and professional clothing closet that is open to students, faculty, staff and community members. Students are welcome to visit the pantry twice a month, while faculty and staff are welcome once a month. Community members who wish to receive food services are required to attend monthly educational workshops that focus on life and career development skills. Upon completion of each workshop, participants are awarded a CARE Resource voucher to use at the pantry. Though the CARE Resource Center is housed under the Office for Community and Civic Engagement, it is primarily managed by student workers and volunteers.

During the 2019-2020 academic year, the department saw 3,196 visits to the CARE Center. In 2020-2021 there have been 1,778 visits. The reduced traffic is attributed to a lower number of students living on campus because of the pandemic. The department remains committed to recovering food to aid those who have remained on campus throughout the unprecedented events.

Coca-Cola have introduced âsensitivityâ training for their employees. White members of their workforce are asked: âTry to be less white.â In order to achieve this Coca-Cola suggests their being âless oppressiveâ, âless arrogantâ, âless certainâ, âless ignorantâ but, instead, âlistenâ and âbelieveâ. Listen to what? Believe what? Arrogant how? Oppressive how? âBe less certainâ of what? How can any white person be any less white than they already are?

The underlying hatred of whites that permeates critical race theory, the nonsense emanating from the Progressive Left that lies behind Coca-Colaâs strictures outlined above, must never be acknowledged. Whites are conscripted against their will into a movement for âjusticeâ in which they are the enemy. Hence the scenes of whites kneeling in the streets like performing seals, acknowledging the god BLM. The hatred is couched in a pretentious, fashionable language â âwhite supremacyâ, âsystemic racismâ â concepts with no fixed meaning that whites are expected to adopt to prove that they are in good standing with the social justice warriors.

How has this come about? Marxâs theory envisaged capitalismâs overthrow by a proletariat (industrial working class) rising up against their bourgeois overlords, the factory owners. But there was a problem with countries that hadnât sufficiently industrialised. Along came the Italian Marxist, Gramsci, who argued that the focus shouldnât be on economic revolution but instead on taking control of institutions that shape culture. That way a counterculture could be created to subvert the established order.

This is what has happened in America and many other countries. Education has been taken over by the cultural Marxists so that schoolchildren are as familiar with discussing critical race theory concepts as they are with Pythagorasâ Theorem. Hollywood is awash with white people desperate to show off their social justice credentials. The media pump out Progressive Leftist propaganda daily.

It was a black law professor at Harvard, Derrick Bell, who came up with the tenets of critical race theory, arguing that everything should be seen through the lens of race â arts, institutions, law, everything. People can choose to accept or reject anything based on whether they believe it is racist or not.

Can you see where this is going? Because the founders (Jefferson, et al), the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are tainted with the stain of racism, they are illegitimate. For the Marxist, that is the signal for them to transform the entire country. Biden has just passed a law legitimising the illegitimate changes to electoral law enacted in the swing states prior to the 2020 presidential election.

The Left in America has cast such a pall of fear over whites that these people are desperate to prove their âwokeâ credentials. They obviously voted in large numbers for the geriatric incumbent of the Oval office whose watchword is âequityâ. âEquityâ doesnât mean âequalityâ, as is evidenced by parents of public school children in New York being told to become âwhite traitorsâ by actively dismantling âwhitenessâ and by the cancelling of a programme for gifted kids in Boston because it was âtoo whiteâ.

Critical Race Theory is racist on its face but nobody dares say it for fear of the backlash. It is pernicious hogwash because it condemns one section of the population to permanent damnation because of the colour of their skin and, however hard they try to atone for their imagined sins, they can never succeed.",,,-0.996980309,1.0,positive,"Opinion Piece Patrick Cooper Patrick Cooper Coca-Cola introduced sensitivity training employees.

JACKSON, Miss. â Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves signed into law on Wednesday a bill banning the stateâs transgender student athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Jace Pierce, a 35-year-old trans man who was born and raised in Mississippi but has since relocated to Oregon because of his wifeâs job, was saddened by the news.

âI feel it just continues to further push the idea that transgender individuals are a threat and thatâs dangerous,â Pierce told the Blade. âI can, at times, understand some concerns that people may have but thatâs only because they are uninformed.â

Rev. Brandiilyne Mangum-Dear, a 46-year-old cisgender lesbian, lives in Laurel, a city in Mississippiâs Pine Belt. She and her gender-fluid wife were both disappointed by Reevesâ decision to sign the bill, but they remain hopeful.

âWe are incredibly saddened and angered by this bill, but we are not surprised. Unfortunately, this is the climate of our state. Bigotry and hate for the LGBTQAI community are deeply woven into the tapestry that is the south,â she said. âThis bill, like the anti-LGBT bills that came before, will be a rallying point for our community.â

Senate Bill 2536, sponsored by state Sen. Angela Burks Hill (R-Marion, Pearl River Counties), is one of many anti-trans measures advancing through state legislatures across the country, according to Freedom for All Americans. SB 2536 is the first to be signed into law this year.

âThis law is a solution in search of a problem, and legislators in Mississippi have not provided any examples of Mississippi transgender athletes gaming the system for a competitive advantage because none exist,â Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said in a press release. âWhile transgender athletes have been competing at every level for years without incident, Gov. Reeves is signing this bill while Mississippians continue to suffer and real issues go unaddressed.â

Mississippi Republicans currently hold a two-thirds majority over Democrats in both chambers of the stateâs legislature. This bill passed both chambers along party lines in the state Senate but with some Democratic support in the House of Representatives.

The new law requires public schools, colleges and universities to âdesignate its athletic teams or sports according to biological sex.â It also bars government agencies, including accrediting and athletic associations, from taking adverse actions against public educational institutions that discriminate against trans student athletes.

The law also states disputes regarding a studentâs gender identity must be resolved by a physician attesting to the studentâs sex âbased solely uponâ a check of the studentâs reproductive anatomy, âendogenously produced levels of testosteroneâ and genetic makeup.

âIf thereâs one thing that we are passionate about in the Reeves family, itâs my daughtersâ sports,â Reeves, a Republican, said in a Facebook post supporting the new restrictions. âI know that the lessons learned through team sports have led to so many successful lives and careers for women and have truly helped provide a more equal opportunity for success in our world.â

Senate Bill 2536 received bipartisan support in the Mississippi Legislature. (Washington Blade photo by Michael Key)

Human Rights Campaign Mississippi State Director Rob Hill, however, said in response to the new law that all children deserve an equal opportunity to participate in youth sports.

âEvery kid deserves the opportunity to learn the values of participation, team work, and work ethic that come with youth sports,â he stated on Wednesday during a press conference.

President Biden on Jan. 20 issued an executive order extending equal protection from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.

The order stated âchildren should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sportsâ and noted the âunconscionably high levelsâ of violence and discrimination that Black trans people in particular face.

Reeves, however, also stated in his Facebook post that he didnât âunderstand why politicians are pushing children into transgenderism in the first place. And my heart breaks for the young women across America who will lose in this radical social experiment.â

Mangum-Dear condemned Reevesâ statements and actions as âtransphobic.â

âGov. Tate Reeves and many leaders in our state are transphobic bigots cloaked in pseudo-Christianity,â she said. âThey choose hate and ignorance over love and truth. We stand firmly with our transgender family and will continue defend our community.â

The text of the anti-trans Mississippi ban cites support from Duke Law Professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, and Olympic gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross. All stated trans females have a âbiologicalâ advantage over cisgender women and âclaims to the contrary are simply a denial of science.â

The bill also mentioned an often cited 2010 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine that analyzed top Olympic performers in swimming and other events and found a persistent performance gap between cisgender males and females since 1983. The measure nevertheless failed to mention contrary or more recent research that either drills down into a particular sport like âSex Differences in Youth Elite Swimmingâ from 2019 or compares performance in different events, such as âThe Age-Related Performance Decline in Ironman Triathlon Starts Earlier in Swimming than in Cycling and Runningâ from 2018.

These studies, for example, found that an athleteâs age, build and the type of event were other important âbiologicalâ factors to consider as well when accounting for performance differences and changes over time.

The youth swimming study, in particular, found âthere were no sex-related differences in swimming performance prior to age 10.â

âSB 2536 isnât about protecting fairness in womenâs sportsâ

âBoys and girls always compete together from the moment they hit the playgrounds,â Pierce said. âItâs not until the adults who âknow betterâ and decide to step in to âcorrectâ that it becomes an issue.â

The Mississippi American Civil Liberties Union, however, stated in their Wednesday release that âSB 2536 isnât about protecting fairness in womenâs sports.â

âItâs about erasing and excluding trans people from participation in all aspects of public life,â the group stated. âItâs about creating solutions to problems that donât exist. Not once have the supporters of this bill cited an actual dispute over this issue in Mississippi.â

HRC noted 55 major U.S. corporations such as Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, Nike and others oppose anti-trans legislation introduced in various state legislatures across the country. They also point out nearly 550 college athletes have demand the NCAA pull championships from states with anti-trans sports legislation.

More than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1,000 child welfare groups also called for legislatures to oppose bills that target trans children, according to HRC.

âWhat makes SB 2536 so much worse than the routine fear-mongering is that it targets children. That cannot be lost in this discussion,â said the Mississippi ACLU in a statement. âWhatever your politics, we should all agree that ostracizing middle and high school kids is not something to celebrate.â

David added in HRCâs statement that âtransgender kids deserve better and so does Mississippi.â

News Corp, Fairfax and the Guardian have all confirmed that former Australian finance minister Mathias Cormann is the OECDâs new Secretary-General.

#OECDSG News: Report from @CSharrockParis recommends OECD Council appoint @MathiasCormann next Secretary-General of the OECD â¡ï¸ Visit https://t.co/XKrtkHmFCL for the latest pic.twitter.com/xFtFA687rw â OECD â¡ï¸ Better policies for better lives (@OECD) March 12, 2021

Several environment groups and climate organisations have attempted to raise awareness about Cormannâs very significant track record on climate policy in Australia. He was central to the Abbott governmentâs attempts to raze every single clean energy and climate policy to the ground.

The entire period was a very dark moment in Australian climate policy history, but the efforts to abolish both the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) stand out as particularly callous, cynical, confused and pointless. Through loans and cash grants to clean energy projects, both agencies have been wildly successful, with the CEFC in particular consistently returning money to Australian taxpayers due to smart investment in profitable clean energy ventures.

âThe Government does not believe it is appropriate to keep borrowing money to underwrite a $10 billion taxpayer funded bank that cherry picks investments in direct competition with the private sectorâ¦..the Government will reintroduce a Bill to abolish the CEFC next weekâ, wrote Cormann and then-Treasurer Joe Hockey, about the government clean energy program that was making money for taxpayers.

Revisiting this time period, itâs astonishing how little effort when into trying to justify actions so pointlessly destructive. It was a big, smirking shrug â anything with the word âcleanâ or ârenewableâ was up for abolition. After the abolition project was abandoned, Hockey and Cormann tried tweaking the CEFCâs performance settings such that it was essentially impossible to meet them, and also tried banning the agency from investing in wind power. Why? There was never a clear explanation, but Hockey also had a specific personal disgust reaction upon the sight of wind turbines.

Cormann was a central player in a dark, cynical and grossly wasteful time in Australian climate policy. It is extremely important not to underestimate the permanent impact on Australia to slam the brakes so hard on climate action. No politician can utter the words âcarbon priceâ now, without being visited by the howling ghosts of the early 2010s.

Of course, Cormann was central to the abolition of the carbon pricing mechanism, in addition to supporting fossil fuel subsidies and a range of other anti-environment actions, as detailed in a viral thread by Greenpeace Australia CEO David Ritter.

In 2011, again from opposition, Mr Cormann claimed to parliament that the Gillard government's âpush to put a price on carbon on the basis that it would help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions [was] a very expensive hoax"": https://t.co/YmwA8b6Bo1 â David Ritter (@David_Ritter) March 7, 2021

Iâve seen Cormann described as either a âclimate skepticâ or a âclimate denierâ. It isnât quite right; Cormann has never denied that climate change is real, and is caused by human activity.

The reality is one hundred times worse: he understands the threat, but has actively worked to worsen that threat through his policy actions. We donât have a good word for this yet, but weâre going to need one.

@HenryIXL I can assure you that Labor's carbon tax is doing nothing about global warming. In fact arguably its making it worse. â Mathias Cormann (@MathiasCormann) January 23, 2013

In the moments after the launch of the 2014 budget, which was targeted largely at taking significant progress Australia had made on climate policy and kicking it all the ground just for the pure fun of it, Hockey and Cormann celebrated with cigars, outside parliament house. They were snapped by a Nine News photographer:

To knowingly slam the brakes on what was very clearly a significant moment of progress on climate action is one thing. To celebrate that moment puffing a big cigar? Thatâs permanently symbolic. It should be the context for every promise of progress and plea sent out in defence of Australiaâs climate delay.

The decision has already been hailed as a âdiplomatic winâ for Australia, which seems like an open admission that Cormann will use his position to act in the interests of Australiaâs government. And those interests are specifically expanding the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, as shown so clearly during the past yearâs âgas fired recoveryâ debacle.

There will be plenty of greenwashing â vague promises of ânet zeroâ at some point well past the retirement age of current politicians and executives, bragging about the outcomes of renewable energy policies they aggressively opposed for a half-decade.

But Australia remains both woefully off track on its domestic emissions and intent on vastly expanding its fossil fuel extraction and sale to other countries in the world. That process will now be significantly easier, with a long-time climate delayer in the top job at the OECD. Itâll be the same impact of worsening emissions, perhaps just without the cigars.",,,0.876965046,1.0,neutral,"A lot worst fears realised yesterday, one Australias central climate wreckers 2010s Abbott era succeeded campaign lead Organisation Economic Co-operation Development (EOCD), massive, influential intergovernmental organisation.

Over the last couple of weeks, I have been paying close attention to the controversies surrounding Governor Cuomo. In that time, I made a very difficult decision both to help the New York Times with their investigation and to go on the record. I did so with heightened fear but ultimately decided that if these women could do it, so could I. To me, principles only mean something if you stick to them when itâs inconvenient.

As many of you know, I spent several years as Governor Cuomoâs Deputy Director of Administrative Services with primary oversight of his New York City office (the Executive Chamber). I wore many hats in that role, including onboarding new political appointees within the Executive Chamber and running our internship program. As Iâve been reading the stories from several female political appointees, what has come to mind for me is what I believe is a significant opportunity to alter the political workplace climate going forward.

Following my time with New York State, I became Chief of Staff to the head of Learning and Development for American Express. Among our teamâs broad remit was the development and deployment of sexual harassment training to over 100,000 employees and contractors globally, each year with the standards and content always improving. This and so many other factors are why American Express remains one of the best places to work in America. At many times Iâve thought back to my time in the Executive Chamber with both curiosity for why such training wasnât commonplace for political appointees and some regret for not having pushed harder for it in my tenure. But I suppose hindsight is always 20/20.

In recent years since the Me Too movement took off, weâve seen changes such as Congress updating their sexual harassment prevention efforts and recently Governor Murphy in New Jersey has mandated sexual harassment training for all of his campaign staff. I believe that trend must continue until all political appointees and campaign workers have the same opportunity. My condition for going on the record was that the article would discuss this. Iâm glad that it did. My hope is that it would spark a broader dialogue about what I consider to be a significant opportunity to improve workplace culture in America, particularly in the public sector and in politics.

Governor Cuomo in many ways has been a political hero to me. I worked with him to get marriage equality passed in New York at a time when things looked shaky for its prospects nationally. I was at his side in the endless days and weeks following Superstorm Sandy as I ran logistics for our command center. One of the interns I hired went on to author the most significant gun control legislation in America and the Governorâs âget things doneâ approach made me believe in the power and possibility of government. America saw this Governor Cuomo in his leadership and communication style so visible during the early days of COVID-19. It is leadership that I have praised.

But, as I have called out former President Trump and others for their behavior, I must do so too even when itâs someone who I both worked for and aligned with politically. The breadth and depth of trauma for women in his orbit over the years is unacceptable. And I stand with them. So with that said, let me state unequivocally that I believe it is time for Governor Cuomo to resign.

This came too soon for all of us, industry and media and friends, family, and associates alike.

Greg was a great person: an idealistic, humble, cool, caring, charismatic older brother to so many of the people he inspired. He was idolized as a pioneer not just because of what he created in Odwalla and Califia, but because he bore the scars that came with having been one of the first entrepreneurs through the door of the natural food business. With hip dignity, he wore both the triumphs and setbacks of a pioneer.

Greg never stopped evolving, or helping the people and institutions around him evolve. Itâs remarkable to me that a guy whose entire life seemed to center around the intellectual liberalism of San Francisco and Northern California could all of a sudden pick up and relocate to flashy Los Angeles, immediately finding community and fellow travelers, identifying substance where others might find vapidity, then actively contributing to its cultural revival by linking the new Califia headquarters with the revival of the Downtown L.A. Arts District.

Greg was part of the ballyhooed group of businesspeople in the late 1980s and early 1990s who pioneered the idea that companies could do well by doing good. Greg, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, Gary Hirshberg, Steve Demos, Emanuel Bronner: their enterprises helped create the legend of this heroic, misfit rebel, the ones who injected social values into the world of consumer commerce.

But I would posit that, among that group, Gregâs business career became legendary because he publicly wore the hard lessons as well as the easy ones. In the 1980s he had started Odwalla Juice, launching the fresh juice category in grocery and eventually taking the company public in 1993. In 1996, at the height of its sales, an E. Coli outbreak traced to Odwallaâs apple juice killed one consumer, sickened others, and the company, rescued from bankruptcy by private equity firms, was eventually sold by those investors to the Coca-Cola Company. As a company, Odwalla eventually pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges, and paid millions of dollars in civil cases â but Odwallaâs leadership also received praise for pulling its product quickly from shelves, offering to pay medical bills, and accepting responsibility for the outbreak before authorities officially blamed them.

The trip to Califia wasnât a direct line from Odwalla. In fact, before that second company, Greg took his lumps with Adina for Life, a failed juice partnership that started as a socially conscious business, this time aimed at supporting fair-trade, organic, and natural ingredients indigenous to different countries and regions. Adina proved to be a case of too much too fast: with Greg and SoBe founder John Bello both on as executives and investors, it faltered under the weight of the personalities and stylistic differences involved. Nevertheless, late in the game Greg turned to high-end ready-to-drink canned coffees in an attempt to gain traction for the brand; as its juice drinks, under Bello, started to seem more and more like a blustery SoBe 2.0, the coffee drinks that Greg favored seemed to be a recommitment to the idea that the substance, and the mission, lay closer to the ground. He was burned by the experience for sure, but he later told me that the pivot to coffee was one of the keys to his vision for Califia.

After a couple of quiet years, in 2010, Greg started to develop a plan for a juice manufacturing business in partnership with Berne Evans, a Bakersfield, California citrus farmer. Early in the business Greg shifted the emphasis at Califia away from juices and towards another prominent Bakersfield crop, California almonds, and the decision to make almond milk caught the industry and the consumer at the right time. Even early on, you could tell that Greg was on to something, that Califia was going to make it, that this really was a second act.

But to really restart his career, Greg also had to overcome a major physical setback after receiving a liver transplant in the spring of 2012.

At coffee bars, almond milk offered a fast-growing alternative to dairy and soy milk, but rather than just offer the product as a coffee additive, he and his partners also started to sell high-quality coffee drinks of their own, made with Califiaâs almond milk. The brand combined voluptuous carafe-style bottles of its unsweetened products, professional-quality almond milk âBarista Blendsâ for coffee fanatics â and great, innovative coffee products of its own that gave it legs in both the coffee and alt-dairy categories.

Greg had cut his own path as an environmental sciences major at Stanford, and he continued to keep environmental activism at the forefront of the work he did in beverage. After the Odwalla debacle, he blamed the private equity investors who had ultimately gotten control of the company after the contamination crisis for forcing the sale to Coke. But he went into the fundraising process for Califia clear-eyed, with a determination that the money was going to enable him to take Califia where he wanted it to go, rather than where his investors might have planned. He surrounded himself with great, cool, interesting, determined and diverse employees and friends. He raised immense amounts of capital, and after passing the CEO job to Dave Ritterbush, he seemed to be settling in as an innovation and mission guide for the company as a board member. When news got out in September that he was giving up the reins, I immediately worried for his health, but he assured me he was fine, the move was his plan, and we started discussing his grandson.

I have so many memories of Greg as a person, but will never have enough memories of time spent with him. We shared drinks and meals, shared laughs, shared a love of Bob Dylan and weird jazz. He showed my kids his house because it looked like Hogwarts. He loved his grandson â the last time we texted, he just kept sending me pictures.

When I first met him, Greg was giving a talk on the ways that companies could responsibly and transparently handle their responsibilities to the public, using the E.Coli outbreak as an example. He had been old friends with a cousin of mine from San Francisco whom I greatly admire, so we had people in common, and we spent a bunch of time talking. I felt like we shared a common, rebellious outlook that gave us a special bond â but I think most people who spoke with Greg felt a special bond with him. I think most people who looked for those bonds really did have them, because his star qualities combined with his innate generosity and sense of fun to make him magnetic. He always drew people â even if they wanted to make sure he wasnât the actor Harry Dean Stanton.

Iâll admit, there were times I thought up panels and conference presentations for Greg just to make sure that I got to spend time with him, either on the phone or on the stage. He always took time to speak with entrepreneurs, with the media, and he taught everyone immense amounts about business, strategy, style. He made you feel smarter when you spoke with him, that you understood business, that you were cooler than you were. I took pride in our bond. We all did.

I would argue that the industry loved him, not because it loved what he stood for â an idea that goes back to Ben & Jerryâs, back to Just Desserts, back to Patagonia and to Stonyfield, that an outstanding experience could also be one that does good for the world â but because heâd survived the gut punches that inevitably come when youâre first to the fight. Youâd look at Gregâs face, and youâd see wrinkles, and eyes that twinkled. It was the combination of the two that taught us so much.",,,0.978226662,0.0,negative,"Greg Steltenpohl, innovative juice executive twice brought progressive, environmentally socially conscious brands national prominence, deep triumphant second act businessman force good passed away week.

(Les Talusan/GreenFaith International Network)

Church bells rang and ceremonial gongs clanged in demonstrations around the globe Thursday as faith groups called for governments and financial institutions to take 10 specific steps to accelerate action on climate change, including an immediate end to support for fossil fuel and activities that cause deforestation. More than 400 events were held in 42 countries as part of the multifaith day of action, called ""Sacred People, Sacred Earth."" It was the first major initiative organized by the recently formed GreenFaith International Network, a partnership of faith organizations in 14 countries coordinated by the U.S.-based GreenFaith environmental coalition. Organizers called ""Sacred People, Sacred Earth"" the largest single day of faith-based mobilization for action on climate change to date. The Rev. Fletcher Harper, an Episcopal minister and executive director of GreenFaith, told EarthBeat the day represented the beginning of an ""escalation and intensification"" by the faith community to increase pressure on policymakers and the financial sector to close the gap between current climate pledges and what is needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the more ambitious target set in the Paris Agreement. ""I think that there is a growing frustration, impatience and even anger that political leaders and financial institutions have failed as badly as they have to address this problem,"" he said. ""The science is getting old on this now. This issue has been staring us in the face for 30 years."" Religious groups have been calling for action for an equal amount of time, he added.

At the center of the day was a list of 10 demands faith groups say are essential if governments and financial institutions are to respond to climate change in a way that reflects the seriousness of the science. The demands were issued with an eye toward negotiations happening ahead of the COP26 U.N. climate summit, set for November in Glasgow, Scotland. The demands call for: Access to clean energy for all people;

An end to new fossil fuel exploration and infrastructure, deforestation and biodiversity loss;

Increased financing for sustainability in agriculture, infrastructure and other industries;

Divestment from fossil fuels and no COVID-19 recovery investments in that industry;

A just transition for workers and communities impacted by the transition to renewable energy;

Defense of the rights of Indigenous communities and protectors of the environment, and assistance for climate refugees;

Wealthy countries achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and provide financing and technology to assist other countries toward the goal of reaching net-zero globally before midcentury. ""A far better future is possible if our collective response to the pandemic and the climate crisis is guided by compassion, love and justice at a scale that meets this moment. We must not only provide the relief that so many need to survive. We must create a new culture, politics and economy of life that heals people and planet,"" reads a statement signed by more than 300 religious leaders. Among the signatories is Cardinal Peter Turkson, head of the Vatican Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development.

The ""Sacred People, Sacred Earth"" events around the world took different forms, but sought to deliver the same message around the demands. One of the first events was held in Australia, where a multifaith group demonstrated outside the office of Prime Minister Scott Morrison and urged him to accelerate the country's climate plans. A mosque in Indonesia held a Muslim reflection on the environment. People gathered with signs on a rooftop in Cameroon, while others in Sierra Leone took part in an environmental project. Four Indigenous women in Chile called on their government to stop repressing the rights of their people and other defenders of the environment. In Belgium, there were 11 minutes of silence for the climate, and people banged on pots and pans as church bells rang in a rural English village. In the United States, church bells rang across the Sun Belt, from Tallahassee to San Diego. In the nation's capital, Unitarian Universalists and members of Interfaith Power and Light gathered near the Washington Monument, where they displayed banners and voiced their support for Indigenous tribes opposing the Enbridge Line 3 pipeline in northern Minnesota, which they say violates treaty rights and crosses sacred land. They called on President Joe Biden to halt the project as he did the Keystone XL transnational pipeline.

""We need this administration to step up and stop Line 3,"" the Rev. Susan Hendershot, president of Interfaith Power and Light, said at the event. Hundreds more protested Line 3 in St. Paul, Minnesota, near the Mississippi River, under which Line 3 is set to cross.

UK released an article with input from several professors. They described how topics, such as systemic racism, is becoming more widely discussed.

The article also detailed policy changes and new initiatives on its own campus. For example: the reorganization of its diversity and inclusion administration.

However, professors said while the changes are a good step, more needs to done â not just at UK, but in the state.

A concern the article points out is that the social justice movement sparked by Taylorâs death is losing momentum.

Michael Clark is an economics professor. He said itâs important to address socio-economic inequities if lasting change, in any aspect of social justice reform, is to be had.

âItâs important for us to understand what those root causes are for those gaps,â Clark said. And then start thinking about being satisfied with this continuing. And then start thinking as we understand what these different causal factors are, how do we develop policy that will effectively address those issues.â

FULL UK ARTICLE BELOW:

LEXINGTON, Ky. (UK Public Affairs) â Last year, on March 13, an unarmed Breonna Taylor â a former UK student â was shot and killed by police in her Louisville apartment. The killing was widely decried as unjustified and unconscionable.

Along with a series of killings of other unarmed Black people in other American cities in the spring and summer of 2020, Taylorâs death sparked a year of social unrest, deep questioning about the depths of systemic racism, and potential and actual policy reforms, designed to hasten change on campus, in the Commonwealth and across the country.

In Kentucky, for example, the state legislature is considering prohibiting some no-knock warrants; making considerable investments in Louisvilleâs west end, which has suffered from the corrosive effects of segregation and racism for decades; and forming a statewide commission that will examine issues of equity and equality.

UK, too, is examining its past and thinking about its future. Last summer, President Eli Capilouto announced the formation of a sprawling Diversity, Equity and Inclusion process â spanning nearly 20 projects and more than 500 people across campus, which can read more about here: www.uky.edu/president/sites/www.uky.edu.president/files/2.19.21_-_a_progress_report_on_our_diversity_equity_and_inclusion_efforts.pdf.

âWe are a place always motivated by a continual commitment to reflection and renewal,â he said. âWe are willing to promote our progress. We also must be willing to just as readily confront and interrogate those times in our past and our present where our deeds did and do not match our words.â

In that spirit of reflection and renewal, UKNow asked subject matter experts across campus three basic questions as the campus and country mark the one-year anniversary of Taylorâs death:

What has changed? What hasnât changed? What needs to change still?

Progress at UK, but still more to do

Anastasia Curwood, a history professor and inaugural director of UKâs Commonwealth Institute for Black Studies, said âthat many white friends and colleagues have become much more aware of the fact that racism persists in our lives. They are beginning to understand that time alone is not the antidote to racism; active antiracism is necessary.â

More specifically, UK has âannounced unprecedented initiatives to address issues of systemic racism,â ranging from a $10 million investment in a research alliance to address racial inequities to the formation of the Commonwealth Institute of Black Studies, said Rafael E. Perez-Figueroa and Kathryn Cardarelli, professors in the College of Public Health.

Read more about each of those initiatives here:

https://uknow.uky.edu/campus-news/capilouto-aaas-faculty-announce-commonwealth-institute-black-studies;

https://uknow.uky.edu/research/uk-creating-multimillion-dollar-research-initiative-around-racial-disparity-inequity

At the same time, they said, UK reorganized its leadership and central administration to better reflect and focus on issues of diversity, equity and inclusion. You can read about that reorganization here: www.uky.edu/president/sites/www.uky.edu.president/files/8-31-2020_0.pdf.

Recently, a number of DEI projects have been given a greenlight, including moving forward with a comprehensive diversity master plan; creating an art fund in which 1% of all capital projects $1 million and above will be designated for diverse art; and the hiring of UKâs first supplier diversity manager.

The College of Public Health, as only one example of college and unit work across the campus, has organized a series of events to foster âan anti-racist academic environment (and) address the role of structural racism in tackling health inequities in the U.S.,â Perez-Figueroa and Cardarelli said.

Itâs a recognition, they said, that âcolleges and universities are uniquely positioned to address structural racism and to prepare the next generation of leaders to address these challenges.â At UK, the commitment to DEI âmust be continuously assessed and the findings must be transparent. The whole university community must engage in ensuring those actions align with the creation of a more inclusive campus.â

But to some, change â to the extent it is occurring at UK and in Kentucky â is not happening quickly enough.

DaMaris Hill, an associate professor of creative writing, English and African American studies, said the university, the state and institutions such as government âhave not engaged in a process of reconciliation with the broader community â¦â

âI am talking about the Black community and beyond the collective identity of people,â Hill said. âAround the world police brutality in the United States is viewed as a human rights violation. Black people were not protesting Breonna Taylorâs death in isolation. Many people of many ethnicities and races around the world recognized the injustice associated with her death.â

Hill believes a âreconciliation process should begin on campus and throughout the state.â And that requires âtruth sharingâ and âtrust buildingâ as part of that process. âSymbolic gestures, such as capital investments, are great ways to start, but these gestures can be viewed like wrapping a broken bone with gauze. More reflective and justice engaging work should be done.â

Economic inequality worsened by a global pandemic

While still a persistent problem, racial economic inequality has been a point of some progress in the last several years, said Michael W. Clark, an associate professor of economics and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research in the Gatton College of Business and Economics.

Specifically, the employment gap between Black and white Americans shrank from 7.7 percentage points in 2011 to 2.3 percentage points in 2019.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic recession, however, stopped the progress, Clark said.

âRecessions having a disproportionate impact on minorities is not a new issue,â he said. âWhile the COVID recession was unusual, it simply magnified longstanding economic and social challenges. These challenges include significant racial differences in employment, income and wealth that contribute to greater economic insecurity for portions of our population.â

Long term, Clark said, as the country emerges from a recession, it will be critical to âdevelop policies that effectively address the systemic causes of racial gaps.â That will require a more complete understanding of âhow factors such as discrimination, school access and criminal justice affect racial economic gaps that will help policymakers develop more effective programs to reduce these gaps.â

A flurry of criminal justice reforms followed by concerns about waning interest

Numerous states across the country are examining police reforms, said Cortney Lollar, an associate professor in the Rosenberg College of Law who teaches and researches in the areas of criminal law, procedure and evidence.

By last October, she said, six states had passed laws banning or restricting chokeholds, and other areas were beginning to require the use of police body cameras during search warrants. And still other states and cities âhave undertaken reforms related to the increased transparency of police disciplinary records and the purchase of military grade equipment for their police forces.â

Unfortunately, Lollar said, the momentum from last summer around criminal justice reform âseems to have waned over the winter months.â Cities such as Minneapolis and Seattle that were contemplating changes to police budgets have backed off.

Going forward, even more consideration needs to be given to rethinking what we ask police to do and how we pay for those initiatives, she said. Much of police work is actually concerned with calls that donât relate to crime, such as mental health checks or addiction issues.

âA shifting of the duties we expect police to undertake would obviously involve the need to expand the infrastructure of social service agencies as well as to think more deeply about the best way to help those navigating issues of mental illness, addiction and poverty,â Lollar said.

Lollar added that more concrete proposals â such as banning chokeholds, prohibiting no-knock warrants, increased use of body cameras and using restorative justice alternatives â are important reforms that need to be implemented.

âRacism will continue to infect all aspects of our culture if we all â¦ do not acknowledge the presence of racially different treatment in all areas of society,â Lollar said.",,,0.994679511,1.0,,"LEXINGTON, Ky.

The event, hosted on Mar. 9 by Canadian Forest Industries, Pulp & Paper Canada and Canadian Biomass, drew a total of 883 registrants, with 621 people attending the live event. (Missed the broadcast? Register for free to watch the recordings).

Women represented 17 per cent of the forestry labour force in 2016. Inspired by the ongoing efforts of industry leaders to dismantle the barriers that prevent or discourage women from entering the industry, and to facilitate conversations about advancing women into leadership positions, CFI, P&PC and CB have been tackling these topics in articles, profiles, podcasts and videos for the past three years â and now via this new event.

âThe courage to create spaceâ

Beth MacNeil, assistant deputy minister of the Canadian Forest Service and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), opened the program with a brief look at how NRCan has created more opportunities for women in forestry.

One such initiative is a program that partners Indigenous and non-Indigenous women on research projects. Another is by requiring successful funding applicants to submit diversity and inclusion plans, and collect statistics that report on the effectiveness of those plans.

âWhile progress is being made, I donât think itâs happening at the pace or at the scale at which it needs to occur,â MacNeil said.

She encouraged leaders to enable inclusivity at all levels of the workforce. One way she does this with her own team is by encouraging ideas, âespecially when they challenge the status quo in a positive way and enhance important values.

âIf you have the courage to create space, to allow your teams to imagine a different world within your organization, and you provide the support for good ideas, good things can happen,â she said.

The power of privilege

Tanya Wick, vice-president of people and services at Tolko, delivered the eventâs keynote, âGet Started: How to Be an Ally.â

Wick is well known for her work in gender equity in forestry, having launched several strategies over the past few years to encourage more women and youth to join the forest products sector. She also is one of three industry representatives on the steering committee for the Gender Equity in Forestry National Action Plan.

âI do want to share with the audience how important this moment is for me,â Wick said as she began. âWhen I started the journey five years ago to change my company and change the industry, at times it felt I was the only drop in a very big pool. And now with over 800 participants here today to hear our message and listen to our story, thatâs pretty amazing.â

She focused on the power of privilege, sharing a graphic to demonstrate the varying degrees of privilege afforded to certain groups based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, wealth, education, health and other markers. âAcknowledging privilege can be uncomfortable,â Wick said. âBut itâs important that we start talking openly about using our privilege to make space for others to find their voices.â

âThis is not a womenâs issue, but a business and workplace issue that impacts growth, innovation and quality of life for all of us.â

When it comes to supporting and advancing women and other underrepresented groups in the workplace, allies are a crucial part of the framework, Wick said.

âAnyone can be an ally,â she said. âAn ally holds a position of power. They take responsibility for making changes that help others be successful. And they transfer the benefits of the privilege to those who lack it. They use their credibility to create more access and more inclusion, and theyâre willing to have the tough conversations that are needed to create awareness and acceptance on these issues.â

She stressed the importance of business leaders taking action on inclusivity to ensure that the next generation of workers are aware of the possibilities open to them, and shared tips on how to listen, be accountable and commit to change.

âThis is not a womenâs issue, but a business and workplace issue that impacts growth, innovation and quality of life for all of us.â

A rising tide of change

Kelly Cooper, founder of the Centre for Social Intelligence and co-chair of the steering committee for Canadaâs Gender Equity in Forestry National Action Plan, walked attendees through the cross-sector work thatâs been done on a countrywide level as part of the action plan, which is now referred to as Free to Grow in Forestry.

The initiative, which initially started as a way to increase the number of women in senior executive positions and technical woodland roles and improve Canadaâs competitiveness in the global market, has evolved to examine the barriers for all underrepresented groups in forestry, including Indigenous people and new Canadians.

The research conducted to build the framework for Free to Grow in Forestry showed four key barriers to entry for women: persistent wage gaps, low retention rates, lack of advancement opportunities and challenging workplace culture.

Cooper said the labour shortage in the forest sector is exacerbated by the low numbers of women (17 per cent), new Canadians (12 per cent), visible minorities (nine per cent) and Indigenous people (seven per cent) working in the industry. The research conducted to build the framework for Free to Grow in Forestry showed four key barriers to entry for women: persistent wage gaps, low retention rates, lack of advancement opportunities and challenging workplace culture.

For the past three years, the committee has been gathering diversity and inclusion data for the sector, identifying gaps to be filled, and developing tools that can be applied by forest sector companies to foster an inclusive workforce. Free to Grow in Forestry is now a website housing diversity and inclusion resources and stories featuring people who are underrepresented in industry. A podcast is forthcoming in April.

Cooper also shared many of the diversity and inclusion initiatives that have been rolling out at companies across the sector ranging from industry to not-for-profit to government to academia.

âAll of our efforts on this project have created a ripple effect across the sector overall,â she said. âAs John F. Kennedy was once quoted as saying, âa rising tide lifts all boats.â And all I can say is, we have a lot of boats in the water.â

Moving from awareness to action

Following a statement from Derek Nighbor, president of the Forest Products Association of Canada, celebrating the achievements of women working in the sector, Kara Biles, director of learning and leadership at Canfor, took the stage to share Canforâs journey to inclusivity â a comprehensive, company-wide strategy that has been underway since 2015.

âIâve personally experienced what a difference inclusion and belonging can make in someoneâs life, because Iâve had my own struggles feeling like I belong,â said Biles, who is Anishinaabe and of mixed settler ancestry from the Batchewana First Nation. She shared that growing up mixed race made it difficult to know where she fit in and led to bullying and stereotyping â and as a result, she attempted to downplay her heritage.

âAlong the way, I realized I did belong,â she said. âWe all have a diversity story, even those you might not expect. Every last one of us knows what it feels like to be excluded. We all want to be welcomed, valued, respected and heard.â

When she joined the forest products sector, Bilesâ difficult experiences as a woman in a male-dominated field led her to want to change things. Now, as director of learning and leadership at Canfor, Biles shared how sheâs been leading Canforâs teams to a more inclusive, equitable and diverse workforce. She underscored that the path to diversity and inclusion is a journey, and not a destination â it requires ongoing work.

âAlong the way, I realized I did belong,â she said. âWe all have a diversity story, even those you might not expect. Every last one of us knows what it feels like to be excluded. We all want to be welcomed, valued, respected and heard.â

This required transitioning an executive commitment into a blueprint for change at the company. âIt was made clear that all employees are expected to contribute to an inclusive workplace culture, and that they would be provided with tools and training to support this expectation.â

Some of the more recent initiatives have included implementing a diversity council, mentoring programs, leadership accountability strategies and staff training. The company has been rolling out diversity and inclusion training across all of its employees at a faster-than-expected rate â the goal was to train at least 75 per cent of all Canadian salaried employees by the end of 2020. So far theyâve trained 100 per cent of their executive leadership and 95 per cent of all staff in Canada.

A need for flexibility

Closing off the event was a panel discussion moderated by Kate Lindsay, senior vice-president at the Forest Products Association of Canada.

Lindsay was joined by Charlene Strelaeff, fibre forester at Mercer Celgar, Fahimeh Yazdan Panah, director of research and technical development at Wood Pellet Association of Canada, Johanne Latour, director of talent and culture at EACOM Timber Corporation, and Lacey Rose, county forester for the County of Renfrew and co-founder of Women in Wood.

The panelists discussed the barriers to women entering and staying in the sector, the ways theyâve negotiated to get to their own positions, and the supports they want to see from organizations to help women advance to more senior positions.

Strelaeff and Latour both stressed the need for flexibility when it comes to job roles, whether for remote work options, flexible travel or field days. Rose agreed, saying that there needs to be more emphasis on growth opportunities for women, with recognition from leaders that external factors like childcare and other traditional gender roles may threaten the ability of women to move up the ladder.

âThere is this conscious and unconscious bias that does exist. Part of it is on us to know how to deal with it, and we need to learn how to be brave,â Yazdan Panah said. âWe need to raise our daughters to be brave.â

News Corp Australia would be hard-pressed to argue it doesnât take a uniform approach to coverage across its newspapers â when it comes to Murdoch critic-in-chief Kevin Rudd, anyway.

Two recent examples show the way the company handles the former prime minister is nothing if not consistent: identical coverage across all the newspapers or nothing.

When Rudd appeared before the media diversity inquiry last month and declared Australian politicians are frightened of Rupert Murdoch, the mastheads across eight states and territories took a remarkably similar approach. The headline was âWhy Rudd is wrong on News: Diversity âshaped by webââ .

But when Rudd appeared at the National Press Club on Wednesday and made headlines in non-Murdoch media for saying âthe age of male sexual entitlement is overâ, News Corp was silent.

Kevin Rudd has said that the Murdoch media monopoly is the âgreatest cancer of all on our democratic institutions"" while addressing the #NationalPressClub today.



The former PM said that the Murdoch Press was in a ""coalition"" with the Liberal and National parties.#auspol pic.twitter.com/7fcK7oH1ZL â 10 News First (@10NewsFirst) March 9, 2021

While the Australian sent Canberra reporter Greg Brown along to cover the address, the broadsheet didnât publish a word of copy, not even a gossip column item. But hereâs the thing: neither did any other Murdoch newspaper. Crickets. Now it wasnât an earth-shattering story, to be fair, and he did criticise the boss relentlessly, but other media including SBS, the West Australian, the Australian Financial Review, Nine, Guardian Australia, the New Daily and Ten covered it extensively.

Rudd had cheekily tweeted to âget ready for fair and balanced Murdoch media coverage tomorrowâ, but there was zero.

A serve of biffo at lunchtime

The Oz might not have published a story but the exchange between Rudd and the Australianâs Greg Brown was pretty entertaining lunchtime television.

Brown hadnât even got his question out when Rudd began to attack him as a partisan Murdoch operative, and accuse him of reading out a question dictated by his editors.

The reporter kept his composure as he asked Rudd whether his behaviour as Labor leader fell short of proper workplace standards, and brought up an incident in 2009 when Rudd allegedly had made a flight attendant cry.

Rudd: âYouâre here in order to do a political job on me. That is what News Corporation does. You never go to the substance of the argument Iâm making, which is: do you have a monopoly on print media in this country? Yes or no?â

âEvery accusation made against me and my prime ministership is taken head-on in my own autobiography. It has 1,500 footnotes. I suggest you go to the footnotes, read them.â

After a bit more biffo, Rudd finished with: âI really think you should reflect on your monstrous double standards as a media organisation.â

Sam Armytage on good outweighing bad

On Thursday Sevenâs Samantha Armytage said goodbye to her viewers after eight long years co-hosting Sunrise with David Koch. She is going out on top in the ratings after keeping Nineâs Today in second spot despite several changes of hosts, including the removal and then return of Karl Stefanovic.

But Armytageâs ratings success didnât always translate to a clear run in the media and she had some pointed words for the press.

âI do want to say that I never fully understood some of the scrutiny, the snarkiness and the bullying from some aspects of the media,â she said, choking back the tears. âBut today we move on from that because there is a new chapter starting and it has been overwhelmingly a good experience in my life.

âMost of all, I thank all of our viewers, who are just wonderful people. There are so many lovely people out there â so many more lovely ones than the nasty ones.â

Donât be a total numbskull.

Canât you read TV ratings?

Iâm delighted with my performance.

I smashed it this year.



Howâs your newspaper going? Because last time I looked, it was about as thin as Victoria Beckham.

Congratulations. ð https://t.co/JRidcxkrGf â Samantha Armytage (@sam_armytage) December 13, 2020

Armytage had a running feud with Sydney Morning Herald gossip columnist Andrew Hornery, who predicted three months ago that she was on her way out, which she denied at the time.

She accused the Herald of running interference for Nineâs Today, as they are both in the same stable since the merger with Fairfax Media.

âGood one, Channel Nine. If you canât beat Sunrise in the ratings, invent a (bitchy) column for some Christmas cheer. What a grot that Hornery is...â

After the 80-minute farewell with tributes from everyone from prime minister Scott Morrison down, news.com.au reported that Armytage had failed to mention Sunrise executive producer Michael Pell in a âglaring omissionâ that was apparently due to a feud between the two. Pell hit back shortly after with a tweet showing the two at a cosy lunch with Armytageâs new husband, Richard Lavender.

Unroyal pitch wide of the mark

Veteran publicist Max Markson tried to get the attention of the media this week with a subject line in a PR email which read âHarry & Meghanâ. The link was not tenuous â it was non-existent.

01:55 Facebook bans users and publishers from sharing news in Australia â video

âThe whole world is talking about Harry & Meghanâs battle with the Royals and this Saturday night 13th March the main topic of conversation will be Anthony Mundine and Michael Zerafaâs battle in the boxing ring in Bendigo!â Nice try.

Jones not missed at breakfast

Alan Jonesâs replacement on Sydney radio, Ben Fordham, continues to do well in the ratings, lifting 2GBâs share again in the latest survey and proving once again that Jones was no irreplaceable after all.

Brilliant from Sky News Australia! Alan Jones lays into ""fake"" Meghan Markle and declares Prince Harry ""long gone, captured by the untruths spread by Ms Markle and the victimhood she professes to endure."" https://t.co/e0czXgLt69 â Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) March 10, 2021

While radio listeners arenât missing Jones in the breakfast slot, the broadcasterâs Sky News program is picking up new fans among rightwing fringe groups overseas.

A Sky video of Jones excoriating Meghan Markle for her interview with Oprah Winfrey was being shared on social media this week by people from the UK and the US, and was a leading story on the rightwing news website the Foxhole.

Planet America glows

Two of the most experienced journalists in the country, former Nine political editor Laurie Oakes and ABC editorial director Alan Sunderland, were given the task of reviewing the ABCâs coverage of the US presidential debates.

Since 2007 the ABC has commissioned external reviews of programming against editorial standards.

The last one was back in October, when former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes found that 7.30 and AM did not cover climate change adequately. The ABC disagreed, saying it did âmore than any other Australian media organisationâ on the subject.

Oakes and Sunderland praised Planet Americaâs John Barron and Chas Licciardello for their analysis, which they said was a âgenuine highlightâ.

âThey are clearly specialists on US affairs who are superb at turning complex material into accessible and entertaining television,â the review said.

On tonight's show I'll be telling an extraordinary story I've been wanting to cover for years; America's deadliest school massacre in 1927, and why it was all but erased from history. pic.twitter.com/ngx9GIv58M â John Barron (@JohnBarronUSA) March 5, 2021

ABC US correspondent David Lipson was singled out for his âpunchyâ analysis, but according to the veteran journos âthe disappointment of the day was 7.30â.

âIts surprisingly brief coverage consisted of a few highlighted grabs from the debate followed by an interview with Oliver Laughland, a Guardian journalist based in the US. The whole section ran less than five minutes, about half the time that [radio program] PM spent on the story. It appeared to be not much more than a token effort.â

The Drum also copped a bit of a serve for having guests who werenât specialists in US affairs, resulting in a âmeanderingâ discussion.

âPlanet America showed there was plenty left to say after the news, and interesting ways to say it,â the review said. âThis more detailed and considered examination of the debate, two days later, was the clear highlight of the ABCâs coverage.â

Loose lips at Sky News

At a Foxtel programming event last week it was revealed â perhaps accidentally â that Sky News was producing a documentary about Malcolm Turnbull and Kevin Rudd, hosted by Chris Kenny and titled Rudd v Turnbull: The Debate.

We say accidentally because Sky News is not giving away any more information about the project.

We do know, however, that producer Rebecca Le Tourneau, formerly of 60 Minutes, approached Rudd for an interview and he not so politely declined. We know this because Rudd posted his rejection letter on Twitter, calling Kenny a ârightwing hatchet manâ.

(Bloomberg) -- Itâs the latest corporate strategy for companies from Tesla Inc. to Square Inc.: shift a portion of cash reserves into cryptocurrencies as digital assets become more mainstream.Still, few have gone as far as MicroStrategy Inc. Eight months after its first investment, the software firm has a Bitcoin holding worth more than $5 billion.Shares of MicroStrategy have rocketed almost 600% since mid-July, boosting the fortune of founder Michael Saylor, a billionaire until an accounting scandal in 2000. The chief executive officer is now worth $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, joining the ranks of the worldâs richest crypto holders, a list that isnât definitive since some fortunes canât be identified or verified.MicroStrategyâs crypto fixation began soon after the pandemic hit when the firm found it had a cash-flow problem: There was just too much of it. After cutting advertising and axing 400 jobs unsuited to home-work, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm was sitting on a cash pile of $550 million with nowhere to put it. Saylor, 56, turned his attention to Bitcoin.âPeople still arenât sure: Are we crazy or are we not crazy?â Saylor said. âThe only way to get economic security is to invest in scarce assets that are not going to be debased by the currency expansion. That is the environment that led us to decide we should consider Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.ââEvery ScarâNot everyone agrees with the strategy.âSaylor equated Bitcoin to a bank â thatâs just ridiculous,â said Marc Lichtenfeld, chief income strategist at the Oxford Club, a financial-research firm that has no stake in MicroStrategy. âWhen you put your money in a bank, the value of it doesnât go up or down by 10% a day.âSaylor has clashed with investors before. In 2000, a shareholder filed a class-action lawsuit against MicroStrategy, alleging it misled investors over the companyâs earnings by booking revenue prematurely to inflate profits.MicroStrategy agreed to restate its revenue figures and Saylor, once dubbed the wealthiest man in Washington, D.C., with a fortune of $7 billion, lost almost all of it in a matter of weeks after shares fell 95%. He and his fellow executives, without admitting or denying the allegations, paid $11 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2000, including $1 million in fines.âItâs made us careful and humble and focused,â Saylor said. âEvery scar informs you, and I wouldnât be who I am without having lived through those experiences.âSteady RevenueSaylor has continued to run the analytics software business he founded in 1989, and has overseen annual revenue streams of around $500 million for the last decade, though sales have dipped in recent years.Bitcoinâs price has soared in recent months, hitting a record above $58,000 last month as big investors pile in and the asset class matures.Saylor shrugs off concern about Bitcoinâs volatility and said crypto critics are behind the curve. He said heâs also put his own money into the digital asset, amassing a personal holding worth more than $1 billion.âIf you go back 10 years, how many people agreed that Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon would own the world?â he said. âWho were the last people to embrace this? Senior members of the establishment.âRaise DebtSaylorâs appetite to acquire Bitcoin didnât stop after the companyâs first purchase. When the majority of MicroStrategyâs cash reserves were exhausted, Saylor raised a $650 million corporate bond and used it to buy more.Saylor said heâd rather issue debt against future cash flow now than save up to buy Bitcoin in five years, when he thinks itâll be pricier.In February, the company raised another $1.05 billion in a bonds-for-Bitcoin offering, and on March 5 it announced yet more purchases. On Friday, Saylor tweeted that MicroStrategy bought 262 additional Bitcoins for $15 million in cash, bringing the total to about 91,326. The firmâs shares closed down 2.5% to $784 in New York.Read more: MicroStrategy CEO Will Consider Raising More Debt to Buy BitcoinThe move has resulted in MicroStrategy becoming a dual-purpose company: part software maker, part Bitcoin investor. While the firm has been transparent about this change in regulatory disclosures, juggling two distinct goals isnât something that investors are accustomed to.âIf youâre a hedge fund and you want to make that kind of a concentrated bet, youâre entitled to do that,â Lichtenfeld said, but âas a software company to make this kind of a bet is completely irresponsible.ââCritical PointâSaylor said the company has been upfront with investors throughout. When MicroStrategy increased its Bitcoin holding, it held a Dutch auction to give shareholders time to sell their stock.âEverybody had plenty of time to digest the news and decide whether theyâre on or off,â Saylor said.With all the attention heâs attracted, Saylor wants to do more than just defend a radical investment strategy. Heâs become something of a global Bitcoin ambassador in recent months, appearing regularly on crypto podcasts and YouTube shows advocating for digital-asset investments.âThis is a really critical point in human history,â he said. âWeâll build a better world on it once people understand it. Weâre still very early.

These investors, which include major firms such as Pimco and Fidelity International, commit to transition their investments to achieve net zero portfolio greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. Theyâll meanwhile try to achieve interim portfolio emissions reduction targets by 2030 or earlier.

The effort announced this week was created by sustainable-investing advocacy Ceres, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change and investor networks from Asia, Australia and Europe and pairs with a similar pledge a few months ago issued by an international collaboration of asset managers.

âA broad group of investors understands that climate change is the biggest risk and the reality of risk cuts across every sector,â Kirsten Spalding, senior program director of the Ceres Investor Network, told MarketWatch. âWeâre not going to see investors just getting out of energy but are going to see them aggressively reinvent low-carbon future. And there are opportunities to make money there.â

Through the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative, the networks are releasing a Net Zero Asset Owners Commitment for asset owners to commit to 10 specific actions. The groups are also publishing a Net Zero Investment Framework to assist both asset owners and managers in using rigorous methodology to align their investments with a net zero future. The voluntary Paris pact urges its nation members to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and more ambitiously below 1.5 degrees, largely by cutting emissions.

The $226.4 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third-largest U.S. public pension fund, is on board. In December, the pension fund committed to a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2040.

âClimate change poses significant risks and opportunities for the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the markets and the economy as a whole,â said Thomas DiNapoli, sole fiduciary of the New York State Common Retirement Fund. âAt the same time, it is becoming clear that efforts to comply with the Paris Agreement are on the rise by countries and companies alike. The actions listed in the Net Zero Asset Owners Commitment provide examples of the sort of forward-thinking ideas investors can use to protect the long-term value of their investments.â

So far, the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative involves 110 investors worldwide representing $33 trillion in assets in management; 22 of these investors representing $1.2 trillion in assets are signatories to the Net Zero Asset Owners Commitment, while the Net Zero Investment Framework is being put to practical use by 33 major investors managing a combined $8.5 trillion in assets.

Net-zero pledges are popular among technology giants and most recently have included Wells Fargo WFC, +2.80% , Goldman Sachs Group GS, +1.96% and Citigroup C, +2.55% , whoâve joined other banking interests.

Cooke,3/12/2021 19:46,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/85802-the-path-to-cultural-competence.html,https://gnewsapi.net/redirect-news-image/4a7f3e5beed1880c850b71f36be95183,"As the poet, activist, and librarian Audre Lorde teaches us: âit is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.â

But how exactly do we learn to recognize, accept, and celebrate peopleâs lives and experiences? One critical step on this path is for each of us to work to develop cultural competence.

As a concept, cultural competence first emerged decades ago in the applied health sciences. It was initially aimed at counselors, social workers, nurses, and other providers who routinely care for people who differ from them. The library and information science and publishing professions came to the game much later. But whether for health professionals or for those of us who produce and provide information, developing cultural competence is about the same thing: raising oneâs cultural awareness and empathy to engage in culturally responsive services and programming.

Simply stated, we learn cultural competence by engaging in ongoing critical self-reflection in an effort to better recognize, prioritize, incorporate, and celebrate the differences of others. But as I wrote about in my last PW column, critical self-reflection is hardly a simple process. It requires our cognizance, and it challenges us to put our emotional reactions and guilt to the side in favor of looking at the bigger picture of what an equitable society looks like. It requires us to be empathetic, and to have intellectual and cultural humility. And it requires us to recognize and reckon with the various privileges and disadvantages that come with our identitiesâand to recognize that sometimes our identities are in conflict with one another.

Similar to the work that we need to be doing to work toward social justice and anti-racism, cultural competence asks that we decenter the Western norms that weâve all been socialized to valueâwhiteness, affluence, Christianity, heterosexualityâand recognize how identities and characteristics outside of these norms are devalued and othered. Cultural competence requires us to look beyond Western norms and standards to think about what's missing and who is missing. Only then can we clearly see the systemic changes needed to address the marginalization and subjugation of those whose voices aren't heard or aren't welcome. Only then can we see the factors that contribute to and perpetuate the systemic racism and inequities that divide our society.

There are many models for developing cultural competence, and many of them present the concept as a linear processâincluding the model, Iâve written about, and extended.

The linear model suggests that we move along a continuum from cultural destructiveness (a hatred that seeks to physically harm and destroy); to cultural incapacity (the hatred is still present, but doesnât manifest itself as physically destructive); to cultural blindness (hatred is replaced with indifference and fake neutralityâfor example, âI donât see colorâ is an avoidance tactic and can be equally damaging); to cultural incompetence (the value of cultural competence is clear, but you have no idea how to achieve it); to cultural pre-competence (youâre on your way to being aware of and celebrating difference); to cultural competence (you are well aware of and celebrating differences and this knowledge is incorporated into your practices); and, finally, cultural proficiency.

However, Iâve come to believe that these linear models do not adequately convey the nuance, dynamism, or fluidity of cultural competence. Instead, Iâve come to think of cultural competence as a cycle, because a cycle conveys a back-and-forth movement, where one makes progress, but also regresses, especially if the effort toward cultural competence is not maintained.

â Cultural competence requires us to look beyond Western norms and standards to think about what's missing and who is missing. â

The linear model also suggests that there is an endpoint, or a checkbox to be clicked at the end of the line. But the process does not end with âproficiencyâ as some would suggest. There is no box checking in cultural competence.

And, of course, we donât live in a vacuum. Weâve seen all too clearly what happens when we donât make the effort to celebrate and truly value the differences of others: People of color are micro-aggressed and stereotyped. African Americans are subjected to excessive police presence and action for sitting in a Starbucks or for birdwatching in Central Park; Asian Americans writ large are beaten, abused, and blamed for creating the coronavirus.

With these and so many other examples of inequitable and, frankly, racist behavior thereâs clearly a lot of work to be done and a lot of cultural competence to be developed. Indeed, some days it feels as though weâre not even at the basic level of humanity as described by Eli Weisel, who said we should ânever let anyone be humiliatedâ in our presence.

I urge you to engage fully with the process of developing cultural competenceâeven when it makes you uncomfortable. Don't be afraid to take risks and to ask the questions that need to be asked. Being able to lean into discomfort signals growth. And I encourage you to get comfortable with the idea of being uncomfortable when it comes to learning new concepts, and to being open to the differences and perspectives of others, even when you may not agree, because that's how we get the most out of cultural competence.

In this age of Covid-19, racial unrest, economic stress, and divisive politics, it is vital that we actively consider the differences of our students, readers, clients, friends, and family. That we think purposefully about how we interact with them. And, that we recognize how diversity and difference bring richness to the proverbial tables that are our jobs and personal lives. Thatâs how we learn to see others as whole people with identities and backgrounds that are as nuanced, complicatedâand equally valuableâas our own.

When the country's all-powerful military controls a vast business empire, âtouching the walletâ can lead to a military coup.



In Myanmar, the two big business conglomerates --- namely --- Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holding Ltd (MEHL) are military-owned. They in turn used the privatisation process to grab publicly-owned enterprises at fire-sale prices, in the decades leading up to 2011's political reforms. Military leaders and the associates of military leaders have also grabbed licenses, land and economic concessions.



Myanmarâs military-owned conglomerates control businesses and investments in sectors ranging from beer, tobacco and consumables to mines, mills, tourism, property development and telecommunications. From SIM cards to beer, from skydiving to jade mining, there are few areas of Myanmarâs economy that escape the long arm of the country's military, the Tatmadaw.



The United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, set up in the wake of the Rohingya crackdown, detailed the militaryâs business interests in a 110-page report that was published in August 2019. The report laid bare the extent of the armed forcesâ involvement in the economy â exposing 106 MEHL and MEC-owned businesses as well as 27 close affiliates to the military. The Tatmadawâs web of commercial interests enabled it to âinsulate itself from accountability and oversight,â the UN said. âThrough controlling its own business empire, the Tatmadaw can evade the accountability and oversight that normally arise from civilian oversight of military budgets.â

âItâs quite unique when you have a battalion thatâs on the front lines and they are shareholders of MEHL,â Montse Ferrer, the business and human rights adviser at Amnesty International, told an international publication. The military is able to use funds from business to support military units, including those committing genocide, and it meant they were not reliant on the defence budget allocation from parliament. Amnesty International published a report last year which estimated that the military enjoyed dividends of some $18 billion from MEHL alone during the 20 years until 2011.

The first National League for Democracy (NLD) government (2015-2020) was reluctant to directly or decisively target the interests of the military, although its opening of key sectors to competition and investment acted as a counterweight. However, in November 2018, an NLD spokesperson pointed to the military domination of key parts of the economy and stated that the government bureaucracy --- historically dominated by retired military personnel --- was a major stumbling block to progress and would be an important target for reform after the 2020 election. That could not happen --- to clip the business interests of military --- as the second NLD government was overthrown in a military coup on February 1, just before the first meeting of the newly elected parliament.

Peaceful activists demanding the restoration of the elected government confronted a ruthless military crackdown. âToday it was the bloodiest day since the coup happened on February 1. We have today â only today â 38 people died. We have now more than over 50 people died since the coup started and more have been wounded,"" the UN special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, told reporters at UN headquarters on Wednesday (March 3).

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) issued a statement on February 4, condemning Myanmarâs coup d'Ã©tat and expressing support for the countryâs âdemocratic transition.â The statement also called for the release of State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and all others arrested during the militaryâs seizure of power on February 1.

âThe hope they have placed in the United Nations and its membership is waning and I have heard directly the desperate pleas â from mothers, students and the elderly. I receive every day around 2,000 messages, for international action to reverse a clear assault on the will of the people of Myanmar and democratic principles,â Burgener warned on Friday, just before the UNSC is set to meet for the second time behind closed doors. She is hinting at the veto power of China and Russia to stymie any possible UNSC action against the military regime.

The US had, meanwhile, condemned Wednesdayâs violence and said it was âappalled and revulsedâ by it. Myanmarâs military rulers attempted to move about $1 billion held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York days after seizing power on February 1, prompting US officials to put a freeze on the funds, according to people familiar with the matter. On February 11, 2021, in one of its inaugural foreign policy actions since taking office, the Joe Biden administration authorized new sanctions and export-control restrictions on Myanmar in response to the militaryâs coup.

India, the world's largest democracy and a neighbouring country, was nuanced in its response, presumably to protect its own security interests in the Northeast. For example, Myanmar helped India conduct joint operations inside its sovereign territory to contain insurgency in the Northeast in June 2015 against insurgents belonging to the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K). Therefore, Indiaâs relationship with Myanmar is unique insofar as India has demonstrated its capacity to work with both a military regime and as well as a democratically-elected leader.

Another Asian giant and a neighbouring country, China has a growing economic clout and geopolitical interests in Myanmar. Beijing is also a supplier of arms and military equipment to several insurgent groups in the country, some of which carry out activities inside India also. Even though the Tatmadaw has a âblow hot and coldâ relationship with Beijing, China is likely to veto any UNSC actions against the military regime.

Ironically, many business groups --- for whom profits is the only bottom line --- have donned the role of defenders of human rights, a role abandoned by many sovereigns. Major western business groups, namely European, American, British, Italian and French chambers of commerce, rejected the military regimeâs invitation to a meet on March 4. However, some Asian business groups from countries like Thailand, Hong Kong and China have not expressed any such concerns.

Australian business group AustCham Myanmar said on Wednesday it has âserious concern over the increasing use of violence against the people campaigning for a return to democratic Government in Myanmar.â Japanese beer giant Kirin has exited its tie-up with MEC since the coup. More than 160 companies, 115 local and 47 international including multinational firms such as Coca-Cola, Facebook, Telenor and Heineken, signed a joint statement to express âgrowing and deep concern over the developments in Myanmar since the declaration of a state of emergency on 1st February.â

""Mainly because I knew that even though those thousands of people that were marching to the Capitol were trying to pressure people like me to vote the way they wanted me to vote, I knew those were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law, so I wasn't concerned.""</p><p>This claim, of course, is obviously false. Five people died directly from the events of that day, including a cop, and two more police officers took their own lives in the subsequent days. More than a hundred officers were reported injured, many of them seriously. Every person who invaded the Capitol was guilty of trespassing, at least, and many have been charged with much more serious crimes. Even the action Johnson himself describes â pressuring lawmakers to vote against a lawful election â is potentially a crime in the context and is certainly a violation of the Constitution.</p><p>Johnson's remarks got even worse when they turned from a blatantly partisan defense of insurrection to outright racism and bigotry.</p><p>He continued: ""Had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protestors, I might have been a little concerned.""</p> <div class=""rm-shortcode"" data-rm-shortcode-id=""c246c2e9f85bc40f4ec2cd04b55556f9"" id=""14b8b""><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet twitter-custom-tweet"" data-partner=""rebelmouse"" data-twitter-tweet-id=""1370434031532314625""><div style=""margin:1em 0"">Blatant racism from @RonJohnsonWI here.

It seems they just reflect what he really thinks. But they're obviously incorrect, and he should recognize as much. He was in danger on Jan. 6 â there were literally bombs planted near the Capitol. His claim that it would have taken to Black Lives Matter to really scare him, even when the actual threat he faced was dire, just highlights his open embrace of irrational bigotry.<br/></p><p>Johnson has been out on a limb on Capitol riots for a while, far further than many other Republicans are willing to venture. During a Senate hearing on the Capitol attack, Johnson read into the record an account from the far-right outlet <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2021/2/23/22297409/ron-johnson-senate-hearing-january-6-insurrection"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Federalist</a> pushing the debunked notion that the Trump-supporting rioters were framed. This was obvious nonsense from the start, and anyone with a shred of credibility recognized as much â but there was Johnson, pushing obvious misinformation from the Senate itself.</p><p>Of course, Johnson's not the only Republican to have a disturbing relationship with the events of Jan. 6. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri arguably helped incite the attack by being the first of the chamber to join Donald Trump's call to oppose the counting of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on that day. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas later joined along, and even after the Capitol was assaulted and lawmakers forced into hiding, seven Republican senators <em>still </em>cast votes against certifying the election. Johnson, it should be noted, wasn't among them.</p><p>But despite the other strong competitors in the race to be the worst senator, Johnson's cumulative turpitude surpasses them all. Sure, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham utterly debased himself with his about-face on and fealty to Trump. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton is a warmonger at home and abroad. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been the bane of Democrats for years, standing athwart many of their greatest hopes and plans.</p><p>Yet what McConnell did, he mostly did as a representative of his party's larger goals. That doesn't exonerate him, of course, but it casts him as more of a cold functionary than a malevolent monster.</p><p>Meanwhile, Johnson seems to go out of his way to be as devious as possible.</p><p>Before the 2020 election, he took up the call from Trump to attack Biden by launching an investigation into Obama-era intelligence activities. And he didn't hide his motivation at all.</p><p>""The more that we expose of the corruption of the transition process between Obama and Trump, the more we expose of the corruption within those agencies, I would think it would certainly help Donald Trump win reelection and certainly be pretty good, I would say, evidence about not voting for Vice President Biden,"" he <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/13/dems-ron-johnson-probe-trump-win-reelection-394987"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">said</a>.</p><p>Such ""corruption"" never came to light, because it was based on lies and distorted facts. But that never mattered for the Wisconsin senator â what mattered was harming Biden.</p><p>These remarks followed <em>another</em> investigation from Johnson and Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley into allegations about Biden and supposed corruption in Ukraine.

When he personally fell ill with the disease, he didn't take it as a treatment. But Johnson was still wasting committee time pursuing these avenues while he had control. Another witness that day argued, falsely, that social distancing and masks aren't helpful in reducing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Whenever a controversial issue arises, Johnson seems determined to get on the wrong side of it.

   passed the Indiana State Senate and has moved to the House
   where its been referred to the Natural Resources Committee.

   The voluntary program would be a win for farmers giving them an
   extra source of income for practices that not only sequester
   carbon but improve soil health and helps control erosion and
   run off.

   Its a win for companies looking to offset their carbon
   footprint by allowing them to buy home-grown carbon credits
   that keep money in the state.

   Its also a win for the Hoosier State as it creates revenue for
   the President Benjamin Harrison Conservation Trust and Clean
   Water Indiana.

   Its sort of like a statewide farmers market for selling
   carbon credits, said Jeff Dukes, Director of the Purdue
   Climate Change Research Center. I think that could be
   appealing to a lot of people who are thinking about selling
   them because it would make it a little bit easier for them to
   figure out.

   SB 373 would task the Indiana State Department of Agriculture
   with creating a roster of technical advisors and certified
   verifiers to educate land owners and establish a properties
   potential for carbon sequestration.

   Forest owners and farmers could sell carbon credits through the
   program.

   Nobodys either required to buy offsets or required to
   participate in the programs. Its totally voluntary, said Tim
   Maloney, Senior Policy Director at the Hoosier Environmental
   Council, one of the environmental groups that supports the
   bill.

   Knox County farmer Ray McCormick started using cover crops in
   1986 as a way of growing soy beans on highly erodible land.

   Ive innovated and grown and learned and taken risk and
   evolved into a farmer now that does 100% no-till, or I call
   never-till, because anytime you work the ground you go
   backwards by shaking up the champagne bottle and releasing the
   soil organic carbon back into the air, McCormick said. You
   never want to till your ground. You want to sequester that
   carbon and keep it in your soil. Its very valuable.

   Using a seeder on his combine, McCormick plants his cover crop,
   an annual rye grass, as he harvests.

   All my fields are green today and its drizzling rain and
   theyre sequestering carbon into the soil to make it healthy,
   McCormick said. The soil health movement is about sequestering
   carbon into the soil, to build soil health, build soil biology.
   By doing that you can also be sequestering greenhouse gasses,
   especially carbon. And its the primary element by which plants
   grow.

   No-till and cover crops also save money on inputs since plants
   in healthier soil dont need as much fertilizer.

   Large corporations with operations in Indiana that have pledged
   to become carbon neutral include Nestlé, Amazon and FedEx.

   This bill would allow those companies to buy Indiana carbon
   credits, keeping that revenue here instead of going to another
   state or overseas.

   There are a lot of companies out there that want to offset
   their carbon footprint somehow, Dukes said. And I suspect
   that a lot of them would like to offset it close to home if
   they can.

   Companies become carbon neutral by reducing the amount of
   greenhouse gasses they release into the atmosphere, and then
   offsetting what they do release by purchasing carbon credits.

   A credit is equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide, something
   that can be hard to visualize. One way to think of it is that
   half the dry weight of a tree trunk is carbon that has been
   pulled from the atmosphere, explained Dukes

   We cant see carbon dioxide in the air but its there. Its
   warming the planet, he said. Basically what youre buying
   when youre buying a carbon credit is a process of pulling
   carbon from the air into some solid substance like wood or
   carbon thats stored in dead roots and microbes in soils and
   storing it there as a solid for many decades.

   The President Benjamin Harrison Conservation Trust and Clean
   Water Indiana can raise revenue by selling carbon credits then
   using that revenue for carbon sequestration.

   The Harrison Conservation Trust buys lands to add to the
   states parks, forests, fish and wildlife areas, and nature
   preserves. Land purchased through the selling of credits would
   not only sequester carbon but provide Hoosiers with more public
   lands for outdoor recreation.

   Theres a lot of positives here and I think thats why you
   dont see many people opposed to it in the legislature, Dukes
   said. Its an easy way to start addressing climate change.
   Nobody should think that this an overall solution to the issue,
   but at least its a reasonable start and has a lot of other
   side benefits.",,,-0.615628481,0.0,postive,"ANDERSON A bill described supporters win-win-win passed Indiana State Senate moved House its referred Natural Resources Committee.

Chicken Cock Whiskey â Bourbon and Rye

BroBible / Cass Anderson

Just like many folks whose interest is piqued by Chicken Cock Whiskey, it was the name and the bottling that caught my attention first. Seriously, how are you not going to stop and take notice of a whiskey when itâs named âChicken Cockâ and has that cool honeycomb detailing on the bottle. Then I sought to find out whatâs underneath the cork and sampled both the Chicken Cock Kentucky Straight Bourbon and Rye Whiskeys. Both the Kentucky Straight Bourbon ($60) and the Kentucky Straight Rye ($70) clock in at 90-proof which really is a sweet spot for me. I love a good piping hot high ABV barrel-proof release as much as anyone but when the clock strikes 5 oâclock the first pour I go to is something smooth that doesnât need water.

The Chicken Cock Kentucky Straight Rye is a medium copper with brown sugar on the nose and a cornucopia of peach, cedar, black tea, and heat on the palate. The Chicken Cock Kentucky Straight Bourbon is a mixture of two mashbills (78% corn, 12% rye, 10% malted barley and 74% corn, 18% rye, 8% malted barley) aged at least two years. On the nose youâll find layers of cake, sticky banana, and on the tongue youâll get waves smooth caramel, and some rye spice. I enjoyed both of these but if I had to choose one, Iâd gravitate towards the Rye but that might be because Iâm hooked on rye lately.

A Hangover Remedy To Believe In

Tempp/iStockPhoto

Iâve tried Hungover AF a couple of times since then, and while it might not be the instantaneous cure-all I look forward to more than flying cars, hoverboards that actually hover, and every other invention people in the past predicted would exist by now, nothing else has come close to delivering the results Iâve been seeking for far too long.

In the end, the best way to cure a hangover is to drink in a responsible manner that prevents you from getting one in the first place. Sadly, I donât see myself developing that kind of self-control any time soon, and if youâre in the same boat, I could not give Hungover AF a more ringing endorsement.

Get Back In Shape With The Help Of New Gear

Iâve been absolutely loving the Janji Runterra Active Tee [$48]. I picked it up about two weeks ago in this same color and have worn it a few times, the fabric feels amazing. Itâs a high-performance shirt built for running or chilling out and itâs constructed from a blend of 75% supimaÂ® cotton and 25% 37.5Â® polyester. Janjiâs commitment to sustainable materials and responsible manufacturing come together in this fast-drying and thermo-regulating high-tech shirt youâre going to love.

You can pair that shirt with the all-new Janji Transit Tech Shorts â Linerless 6â³ [$74]. These all-purpose shorts come in three colorways (Iron, Ranger, and Thunderhead) and the shell is a blend of 88% polyester and 12% spandex. I scooped these shorts when I got that shirt above and Iâm almost embarrassed to admit how often Iâve been wearing the shorts. Iâm hooked. They are treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish to shed light rain, built from a two-way fabric thatâs designed to move naturally with your body, and the double-weave interior facing design prevents the fabric from sticking to sweaty skin while you hit the trails or go for a run. Iâve mostly been wearing them around the house but they really are built to tackle everything.

The first thing that caught my attention about this release wasnât even the whiskey, itâs the iconic Art Deco bottles that look like the crystal decanters I remember at my grandmaâs house as a kid. Iâm a sucker for appearances and while the bottle caught my attention itâs whatâs under the cork that really blew me away.

These three industry experts came together to produce an out of this world line of 100% Rye Whiskey finished in Bordeaux wine barrels.

But as many of the same brands recover financially, the workers who make their products are not sharing in the comeback.

Over only three months last year, March through May, millions of workers, nearly all women, employed by international apparel factories did not receive between $3 billion and $5 billion in estimated owed wages, according to a study by the Clean Clothes Campaign. A just-released study from the U.K. nonprofit Business & Human Rights Resource Centre found that while some of those workers (all earning a monthly wage between $26 and $192, a range well below the living wage in each respective country) have since been paid a portion of what they are owed, many thousands have not.

The group investigated eight factories with reports of unpaid workers and seven of them turned up workers who remain wholly or partially unpaid âin spite of policy commitments from all fashion brands to ensure workers are paid for making their clothes,â the report said.

âA year into the pandemic, with growing profits, and after witnessing the utter destitution of workers, brands donât have an excuse for failing to protect the basic rights of garment workers,â Thulsi Narayanasamy, senior labor rights lead at BHRRC, said. âItâs not optional to ensure legal wages and benefits are paid in your supply chain.â

Factories investigated were in Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Ethiopia (the country with the lowest wages) where workers have gone either unpaid or only partially paid for their past work manufacturing apparel for major U.S. and European brands. These include L Brands, owner of Victoriaâs Secret; Nike; Leviâs; H&M; The Childrenâs Place; PVH Corp.; Hanesbrands; Matalan; Sainsburyâs; Next; New Look; River Island; Markâs; and s.Oliver.



The report found that such brands recorded profits of roughly $10 billion in the second half of 2020 alone. Certain companies, like PVH, H&M and Nike, told the BHRRC they are aware some factory workers have gone unpaid and are working to resolve the issue. But for many workers the process seems to be taking an undue length of time and often, they end up being paid only a portion of what theyâre owed.

âThe business model of fashion brands and the structure of global garment supply chains is built on an extreme inequality of power that creates and sustains poverty wages for garment workers,â Narayanasamy said. âTo then have so many cases of not even paying workers during such a vulnerable time is excruciating.â

By outsourcing production to international factories that typically provide apparel for several brands at a time, fashion companies typically avoid responsibility for paying factory workers, because they technically do not work for the brand they dye, cut and sew apparel for. Taking responsibility for the entire supply chain is a central aspect pushed by sustainability advocates and experts and is even being required under some new laws in Europe.

One such case of workers going unpaid is at Violet Apparel, a factory in Cambodia, where workers were paid a monthly rate of $192 (the countryâs living wage estimate is $588 a month) before it suspended all of them in May 2020 and then shut down in July. More than 1,200 workers claim to have gone wholly unpaid in their work at Violet producing goods for Nike and Carterâs, the childrenâs apparel company. While Carterâs did not respond to any of the BHRRCâs inquiries regarding the factory, Nike told the group it has not used it since 2006. However, evidence from the factory, including photos and dated order forms, purportedly shows Violet making Nike apparel that was then sent on to another factory, Olive Apparel, which is indeed a Nike supplier.

The Cambodian Alliance for Trade Unions said it found Violet workers have been âmaking Nike products for yearsâ and that the brand is currently working with âsister factoriesâ of Violet in Cambodia for its products.

âIf Violet does not pay compensation properly according to the law, we believe that Nike should take responsibility,â the CATU said.

There is precedent for major companies taking responsibility for unpaid factory workers. Last year Starbucks, Tesco and Disney agreed to pay two dozen Thai workers $115,000 after they were found to be underpaid by a factory that produced their goods. NBCUniversal last year made a similar decision, paying $20,000 to another set of underpaid Thai factory workers. Also last year, Ted Baker, Joop and Massimo Dutti made up for intentionally shorted wages for Romanian workers at the Tanex factory producing their goods.

While the BHRRCâs investigations have found roughly 9,800 factory workers remain unpaid or underpaid since the pandemic started, the group said it does not have an exact figure for how many total industry workers have been affected by âwage theft.â Many apparel factories closed outright. Gap, for example, told BHRRC late last year that 15 of its factories closed, but that it had agreed to pay in full for all finished goods. Leviâs also noted in its response that âseveralâ of its suppliers closed, but declined to specify how many.

The overall lack of clarity into how many workers remain unpaid, dubbed âwage theftâ by labor advocacy groups, is in large part due to the fact that a number of companies do not monitor what happens in the factories they use, or decline to disclose whether they do. The BHRRC at the end of last year asked more than 50 brands and fashion companies about their monitoring of factories, and 14 did not respond at all. Those include HermÃ¨s, Boohoo, Walmart, Hanesbrands, Tapestry and LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, among others. Many luxury brands have been noted in the past for a lack of transparency in their manufacturing and supply chains.



âPayment of living wages as an industry standard would level the playing field for fashion brands and be transformative for workers ,â Narayanasamy said, ânot only for a just recovery from the pandemic, but also to prevent the scale of crisis from repeating again.â

Andrew Cuomo, joined others in calling for the New York governor to resign in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. Cuomo has denied the allegations, most recently on Friday.

Yacobellis, who served from 2011 to 2014 as the governorâs deputy director of administrative services, told the New York Times he âoften heard inappropriate jokes about the type of women the governor liked to hireâ and added there was no significant training on sexual harassment during that time period.

âTraining could have been the antidote to curing what was clearly a toxic environment for many women in the governorâs office,â Yacobellis told the Times.

Yacobellis, who praised Cuomoâs leadership in an opinion piece last April, shared his own take Friday on the controversy surrounding Cuomo, explaining how he made the decision both to help The New York Times with their investigation and to go on the record.

Yacobellis writes:

Over the last couple of weeks, I have been paying close attention to the controversies surrounding Governor Cuomo. In that time, I made the decisions both to help The New York Times with their investigation and to go on the record. I did so with some fear, but ultimately decided that if these women could do it, so could I. To me, principles only mean something if you stick to them when itâs inconvenient.

I spent several years as Governor Cuomoâs Deputy Director of Administrative Services with primary oversight of his New York City office (the Executive Chamber). I wore many hats in that role, including onboarding new political appointees within the Executive Chamber and running our internship program. As Iâve been reading the stories from several female political appointees, what has come to mind for me is what I believe is a significant opportunity to alter the political workplace climate going forward.

Following my time with New York State, I became Chief of Staff to the head of Learning and Leadership Development for American Express. Among our teamâs broad remit was the development and deployment of sexual harassment training to over 100,000 employees and contractors globally, each year with the standards and content always improving. At many times Iâve thought back to my time a decade ago in the Executive Chamber with both curiosity for why such training wasnât commonplace for political appointees and some regret for not having pushed harder for it in my tenure. It simply wasnât and still in many places isnât the norm in those types of work environments.

But, in recent years since the Me Too movement took off, weâve seen changes such as Congress updating their sexual harassment prevention efforts and recently Governor Murphy in New Jersey has mandated sexual harassment training for all of his campaign staff. I believe that trend must continue until all political appointees and campaign workers have the same opportunity. My condition for going on the record was that the article would discuss this. Iâm glad that it did. My hope is that it would spark a broader dialogue about what I consider to be a significant opportunity to improve workplace culture for women in America, particularly in the public sector and in politics.

Governor Cuomo in many ways has been a political hero to me. I worked with him to get marriage equality passed in New York at a time when things looked shaky for its prospects nationally. I was at his side in the endless days and weeks following Superstorm Sandy as I ran logistics for our command center. One of the interns I hired went on to author the most significant gun control legislation in America and the Governorâs âget things doneâ approach made me believe in the power and possibility of government. America saw this Governor Cuomo in his leadership and communication style so visible during the early days of COVID-19 â leadership that I praised.

But, as I have called out former President Trump and others for their behavior, I must do so too even when itâs someone who I both worked for and aligned with politically. The breadth and depth of trauma for women in his orbit over the years is unacceptable as it was for those around President Trump and many other powerful men before them. And I stand with those women. This isnât about cancel-culture. This is about whether someone is fit to be an employer.

I believe it is time for Governor Cuomo to resign. For those who say he should be deemed innocent until proven guilty, I say thatâs the standard for a courtroom, not for an employer with thousands of employees.

I also believe all elected officials and candidates for office must see to it that their offices and campaigns have both sexual harassment policies and sexual harassment training for workers.

   Protestant Reformation in part based on his critique of
   indulgences offered by the Catholic Church.

   At the time, a friar named Johann Tetzel had been encouraging
   the faithful to buy indulgences, which entitled the purchaser
   to forgiveness for sins.

   Tetzel had been selling the indulgences to raise money to build
   St. Peters Basilica.

   On Oct. 31, 1517, in the formal tradition of proposing a
   debate, Luther nailed to the door of the cathedral in
   Wittenberg, Germany, his now-famous 95 theses.

   The act slowly began the Reformation. Why does not the pope,
   whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest
   Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with his own money
   rather than with the money of poor believers? Luther asked in
   the 86th thesis.

   The Catholic Church continued the practice, and Luther oversaw
   the rise of Protestantism and a clear division in faith
   teachings and practices.

   Fast-forward to the 20th century and the newest religion on the
   scene has picked up the practice of offering indulgences.

   Secularism is, in fact, a religion.

   It has sacraments such as support for abortion rights.

   It has tithing in which secular adherents give money to various
   political and social causes.

   It has liturgies in the new speak of wokeness.

   It has theological tracts and church services as rally and
   protest and Episcopal Mass.

   It has even spurred the rise of terrorist zealots and the new
   censorious social justice warriors I have taken to calling
   Woke-O Haram.

   Secularism has various denominations.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and The Rev. Al Sharpton, both purported
   religious pastors who have embraced secular causes, were famous
   in the 1980s and 1990s for pressuring corporate America to pay
   indulgences to their various social justice causes, most often
   aligned with race issues.

   If a corporation did not pay, it could expect calls for
   boycotts and protest from the secular religious adherents.

   In secularism, there is no concept of grace, which remains a
   uniquely Christian concept of giving people that which they do
   not deserve.

   Likewise, secularisms eschatology, or study of the end times,
   tends to be bleak.

   You die; the worms eat your body; and Simba sings about the
   circle of life until the sun explodes, everything incinerates
   and the universe goes dark.

   The environmentalist denomination of secularism is one of the
   most militant.

   It has both the most violent terrorists and the bleakest
   eschatology.

   In it, the world is going to end as the planet heats up due to
   mankinds behavior.

   Salvation is found by abandoning fossil fuels and rejecting
   many of the pleasures of life.

   Unfortunately, there is no escape from damnation, even for the
   saved, so long as the lost are still allowed to pollute.

   The only way for the environmentalist to save himself is to get
   rid of the polluters.

   There is, however, one exception.

   Environmentalists have embraced indulgences, relabeled in some
   cases as carbon offsets.

   FedEx is the latest polluter to discover a path away from the
   woke mob is to pay up.

   On March 3, 2020, FedEx unveiled its plan to become carbon
   neutral.

   FedEx, however, has a problem. It has a fleet of 679 fossil
   fuel-burning aircrafts, and carbon efficiency in aviation is a
   pipe dream.

   FedExs fleet generates roughly the same carbon emissions as
   three coal power plants.

   FedEx will get around the problem of jets through an
   indulgence.

   The company will fork over $100 million to Yale University to
   fund a climate research facility it will call the Yale Center
   for Natural Carbon Capture.

   It will pay salaries to priests of the environmental religion.
   Their theological studies will center around creating new ways
   to employ even more environmentalists and find ways to offset
   greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline
   emissions, according to their press release.

   FedEx, of course, has the money to buy the indulgence. The
   carbon-emitting family down the street does not. Therefore,
   they must be deprived of vehicles of reasonable size, plastics,
   cheap lightbulbs, etc. Their costs will go up. The wokes will
   sleep well at night while the poor, yet again, suffer the
   heaviest burdens of secularism.

Kuehne+Nagel customers can now benefit from immediately available SAF solutions to avoid CO2 emissions of their air freight globally.

As part of the Net Zero Carbon programme, Kuehne+Nagel is proactively advancing its sustainable and scalable solutions to decarbonise air freight shipments. SAF is currently the most effective measure to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of aviation and foster transition to carbon neutrality. With the newly launched SAF offering, customers can power their products with alternative fuel directly via the logistics provider. Kuehne+Nagel portfolio of sustainable solutions will be further expanded with innovative and easy shipping options.

Yngve Ruud, Member of the Management Board of Kuehne+Nagel, responsible for Air Logistics, comments: ÂThe demand for environmentally friendly air logistics services is certainly on the rise. Through the innovative collaboration with American Airlines, we commit to support our customers` sustainability ambitions and contribute to the development and widespread use of alternative aviation fuels. We encourage all the industry stakeholders to join us in bringing carbon neutral flying one step closer.Â

ÂPartnering with Kuehne+Nagel as part of our effort to reduce the impact of aviation on our planet has been an incredible example of the kind of collaboration that will drive real change,Â said Jessica Tyler, President of American Airlines Cargo and Vice President of Operations Innovation & Delivery. ÂThis strategic, market-based solution will help create a cleaner supply chain and is aimed at accelerating our transition to a low-carbon future.Â

SAF is a key element to mitigate aviationÂs impact on climate change. While the carbon lifecycle of fossil fuels is linear and releases additional CO2 emissions, the carbon lifecycle of SAF is circular aimed at re-using waste or biomass and emissions produced. The result of SAF use is a significantly reduced amount of additional carbon introduced into the global carbon cycle of at least 75%. To ensure full carbon neutrality when using SAF, the remaining CO2 emissions generated during production, processing and transport of SAF can be avoided by overcompensating the amount of jet fuel kerosene replaced by SAF up to a ratio of 1:1.33 or offset via Kuehne+Nagel through carbon reduction projects that carry currently the highest quality certification ÂVerified Carbon Standard (VCS)Â and/or ÂGold Standard (GS)Â.

About Kuehne+Nagel Net Zero Carbon Programme

While corporate sponsorships have been common at the NCAA level for some time now, selling off specific team naming rights or position naming rights is somewhat in its infancy.

BEVERLY HILLS, CA â The NAACP recently announced that Civil Rights Movement icon Rev. James Lawson will receive the prestigious NAACP Chairmanâs Award during the 52nd NAACP Image Awards. The Chairmanâs Award, which is sponsored by Wells Fargo, is bestowed in recognition of individuals who demonstrate exemplary public service and use their distinct platforms to create agents of change.

âLast summer, we saw millions around the world take to the streets in the most powerful protests for racial justice and civil rights in a generation. These protests were inspired by the work of Civil Rights Movement leaders like Rev. James Lawson,â Chairman Leon W. Russell said. âIn this pivotal moment for Black history, there is no better time to recognize Rev. Lawsonâs tremendous contributions to American history and to live up to his example.â

Unfortunately, this homage is nothing more than lip service if women are still kept outside their boardrooms.

An International Energy Agency (IEA) commentary reveals that fewer women reach senior roles in the energy sector than in the broader economy. The commentary further revealed that boardroom participation in energy companies for women is between 3-4% compared to other sectors like finance and communication that have up to 21%.

Cecilia Tam, an analyst with the IEA in a 2018 report quipped âThe energy sector remains one of the least gender-diverse sectors in the economyâ. One research by S&P Global shows that only 1% of CEOs in oil and gas companies around the world are women, with women holding less than 17% executive jobs in the sector. A recent LinkedIn analysis found that women make up just 26.7% of all oil and gas industry profiles on the platform, the lowest percentage of any of the dozen industries examined in the analysis.

READ:

The Wall Street Journal, in a report titled âWhere Are All The Female CEOs?â examined why with women earning majority of college degrees today and making up roughly half of the workforce, there is still a very negligible percentage of women CEOs. These statistics are worrying, and do in fact question the pomp and pageantry employed in marking International Womenâs Day across these companies. The Nigerian energy sector has become a boys club. A critical look at the top ten oil and gas companies in Nigeria reveals that they all have male CEOs.

So how can we make more female CEOs in the energy sector? As the Wall Street Journal points out in one report, âthe traditional stepping stones to the Chief Executive position are jobs responsible for the bottom line and those roles are still overwhelmingly filled by menâ. With women left out of these roles where their work directly contributes to the bottom line and their managerial/leadership expertise is determined, there is no training ground for them or opportunity to assess their abilities there. As such when appointments to C-Suite positions are made, they are not considered. Instead, these women typically hold support roles in information technology, human resources and legal.

There is no justification for women being outside the boardroom. An S&P Global market Intelligence report revealed that companies with women in the boardroom tend to perform better than those that have less gender-diverse boards and companies with more gender-diverse boards tend to have higher credit ratings.

A study by the Petroleum Equipment and Services Association (PESA) found that companies with at least 30% female leaders end up raking in 6% higher net margins, and companies with a higher percentage of women in executive positions have a 34% higher total return to shareholders than those that do not. A McKinsey research showed that companies in the top quartile for executive team gender diversity are 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability than those in the fourth quartile.

There is more â A World Economic Forum (WEF) study has shown that companies with strong female leadership deliver a 36% higher return on equity while Grant Thornton reports that companies with at least one female executive board member have historically outperformed those with male-only boards. American Express in its leadership style research reveals that women outperform men in 12 of the 16 essential leadership traits.

With these overwhelming statistics, it is counterintuitive for the Nigerian energy sector to keep its women out of the boardroom. Also, in the very few places where we have women energy company CEOs in Nigeria, we can see the commendable work they have done; Audrey Joe-Ezigbo with Falcon Oil, Catherine Uju-Ifejika with Brittania-U, Amy Jadesimi with LADOL, amongst others.

Supporting women starts with disbanding the boys club. And this has to be intentional. There has to be a positive commitment of Nigerian energy companies and their leaderships to promote a culture that openly encourages women participation. These companies should invest in scholarships, mentorship programs, career talks in schools and other programs for young women, encouraging them to explore STEM fields in order to increase the number of women seeking energy sector careers.

They should openly advance gender-equality goals and place women in more functional, leadership and managerial roles, rather than only support roles. In recruiting, they should be intentional about providing incentives for women, like a clear path to the top, flexible hours, maternity leave that does not compromise womenâs work benefits and ample career development prospects.

We cannot honestly say the future is female when the female is outside our energy boardrooms. This essentially means we are locking the future outside.

Above: A recent protest against anti-transgender legislation in Alabama

Far-right hostility to transgender Americans has reached record proportions, at least in state legislatures around the nation.

As of this week, 82 anti-trans bills have been introduced at the state level in 2021, the most in history, according to a count released Friday by the Human Rights Campaign. The previous record was 79, set last year.

About half of the 2021 bills would bar transgender athletes from participating in school sports designated for the gender with which they identify; those are aimed primarily at keeping trans girls and women from competing alongside cisgender females. The next largest portion of them, nearly 30, would prohibit gender-affirming medical care for minors, in some cases making the provision of such care a felony.

The 82 anti-trans bills are among 158 total anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in state legislatures, according to HRC. Many of the measures targeting the LGBTQ+ community as a whole are so-called religious freedom bills, a type of legislation that can often lead to discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and others in the name of religion.

The rise in anti-trans legislation is a sign of backlash to progress made by trans Americans and other members of the LGBTQ+ population, HRC President Alphonso David said.

âIn a year that has taken a toll on each and every one of us, it is shocking that anti-equality extremists in state legislatures across this country have dedicated an unprecedented amount of time and energy to attacking the LGBTQ community and particularly LGBTQ youth,â David said in a press release. âThe furious pace of these bills shows that hateful anti-equality groups across the country and extremist legislators alike realize that equality is gaining momentum. This is their shameful attempt to throw a wrench into the progress we have steadily made in the fight for equality.â

The only anti-trans bill that has been signed into law so far this year is a school sports bill in Mississippi, which Gov. Tate Reeves signed Thursday and which goes into effect July 1. The Republican governor said the legislation was necessary because of President Joe Bidenâs executive order on LGBTQ+ rights, which Reeves asserted âencourages transgenderism amongst our young people.â Bidenâs order does not actually encourage anyone to identify in any specific way; it merely puts the federal government squarely in opposition to anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination.

In South Dakota, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem has said she will sign a similar bill into law. She already signed a religious freedom bill that civil rights groups say will enable discrimination by individuals and businesses citing religious objections to LGBTQ+ people, members of minority faiths, and others.

Anti-trans sports bills have been passed by one state legislative chamber in Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Arkansas, while bills targeting medical care have received the approval of one chamber in Arkansas and Alabama. The latest bills introduced were measures on medical care in South Carolina and Texas and one on sports participation in Michigan.

The rash of legislation is being driven largely by national far-right groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom, which wrote Montanaâs bill. Itâs also being driven by misinformation. Supporters of the sports bills claim that trans women are threatening womenâs sports, when in fact most lawmakers backing them canât name a single instance where trans participation has created a problem in their state, or even an instance where a trans athlete has competed. Similarly, those seeking to deny medical care claim that puberty-blocking drugs given to trans youth have irreversible effects (they donât) and ignore the fact that genital surgery is not performed on minors.

There is widespread opposition to anti-trans bills, and not just from LGBTQ+ civil rights groups. More than 55 major corporations have endorsed a statement against these bills and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in general; they include Facebook, Pfizer, Microsoft, AT&T, Apple, Dell, American Airlines, and many more. Nearly 550 college athletes have signed a letter to the National Collegiate Athletic Association demanding that championship games be pulled from states that have anti-trans sports laws or are close to enacting them. More than 1,000 child welfare groups have taken a stand against legislation that would keep trans youth out of school sports or deny them health care.

States that enact anti-LGBTQ+ legislation often experience boycotts, as was the case with North Carolina and its anti-trans âbathroom billâ in 2016 and Indiana with its discriminatory religious freedom law in 2015. The former has now been repealed, the latter amended. Idaho last year became the first state where an anti-trans sports bill became law, and it is now the subject of a court challenge and has been blocked by a federal judge.

And LGBTQ+ rights groups are continuing to fight. âTodayâs milestone serves as a reminder of the intensity of our opposition and just how hard we must continue to work to overcome discrimination and exclusion,â HRCâs David said. âProgress in the fight for equality has always come in fits and starts but nevertheless marches forward. We know we are on the right side of history.â",,,0.863638401,1.0,negative,"Most seek keep trans girls women female sports teams prevent trans youth receiving gender-affirming medical care.

IPAN co-founder Sherrina Krishnan-Leyow said proceeds from the sales of the books would be channelled towards its future rescue missions, which she hopes to restart after the movement control order (MCO).

To date, IPAN has re-homed about 3,200 dogs and 2,020 cats.

""IPAN's rescue work incurs large bills for veterinary care, food and medicine. We have always participated in bazaars and flea markets to raise funds for our cause and to raise awareness of the importance of adopting stray animals. But things changed during the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Since the start of the first MCO, we had orphaned kittens and pregnant cats coming out in force, searching for food around closed mamak stalls, and crying out for help. Bazaars couldn't operate during the MCO so many volunteers had to dig deep into our pockets to help these animals. But we are running low on funds to save more animals,"" said Krishnan-Leyow, 50, in an email interview from Petaling Jaya recently.

The book, released last December, features many of the cats that IPAN rescued over the years. One of the most poignant stories is of William Douglas Kendall, a cat with severe broken hind legs, rescued from a park.

""Thanks to crowd-funding, the cat successfully underwent surgery so he could walk again. He was named Will because of his determination to survive. Will has been adopted and now lives surrounded by love and luxury in Bukit Tunku in Kuala Lumpur,"" said Krishnan-Leyow, the owner of a Kuala Lumpur-based video production house.

She had originally wanted to limit the number of cat dedications to 101 but ended up featuring 258 photos.

""Our adopters and friends kept sending their delightful photos of the cats, and we found it hard to turn any away. Once we reached 258 we had to stop, otherwise the book would have been too large to produce. All the photos were sent to us with such goodwill for what we were trying to achieve for the animals. We couldn't turn that love and support away,"" said Krishnan-Leyow, who withdrew funds from her EPF savings to finance the project. Other generous donors also helped to contribute to the cost of the production.

To save on printing and publishing costs, Krishnan-Leyow dove into online training and learned how to design a desktop book using Adobe Illustrator. IPAN co-founder Catherine Leyow took on the task of selecting the pictures and writing many of the inspirational quotes.

""We included some quotes from well-known thinkers, including human rights advocate Datuk Ambiga Sreenevasan, the late film director Yasmin Ahmad, US vice president Kamala Harris, and TV talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. We also had the privilege of contacting many of our adopters and supporters, some of whom gave us pictures and quotes of their own.

""We are proud and excited about the book, knowing that the proceeds will help us continue our spay-and-neuter campaign, as well as the rescue and rehoming work, sustainably,"" said Krishnan-Leyow, who shares stories of the book (RM39.90) on 258 Inspirasi Kucing on facebook.com.",,,-0.936018229,0.0,positive,"After six years rehoming rehabilitating stray animals, Petaling Jaya-based non-profit group Independent Pet Adoption Network (IPAN) released 258-page inspirational desktop book featuring many pictures rescued cats.

REUTERSWith a stroke of his pen on Thursday, President Joe Biden ushered in a series of sweeping pandemic relief measures: checks of $1,400 or more to individuals and families, a new child tax credit hailed as a revolutionary anti-poverty measure, and a major tax break for millions of people who took unemployment benefits last year.In an instant, however, the $1.9 trillion relief bill created a crushing amount of work for the government agency tasked with making its lofty programs a reality: the Internal Revenue Service.The perennially overworked and widely loathed tax agency had already been struggling to achieve its main annual goalâprocessing income tax filingsâeven before the American Rescue Plan passed. As of Thursday, it is sending out tax refunds 32 percent slower than it did last year, according to the agencyâs weekly tax seasons statistics report. In February, the IRSâs internal watchdog said that only one out of every 11 calls to the agency were even getting an answer.Now, in the middle of tax-filing season, the IRSâ mission has ballooned thanks to the pandemic relief plan. First, it must send out another round of stimulus checks to a large share of the countryâs population. Then, the agency has to work through the billâs changes to unemployment insurance taxation: with Democrats making the first $10,000 in benefits tax-free, many recipients who already filed their taxes will want to access that benefit, and the IRS has to figure out how to facilitate that. On top of that, the agency is responsible for readying a sweeping expansion of the child tax credit, which will now come in the form of a $300 monthly payment per child, to help millions of families in the coming weeks and months.Looming over all of this, of course, is the filing deadline on April 15. Some lawmakers have called for the IRS to extend the filing period as it did last year, but thereâs no indication yet that will happen. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Among tax policy experts and lawmakers who closely watch the IRS, these mounting duties, and the tight deadline, are creating serious anxiety. âI would never say never when it comes to the IRS and its ability to implement new legislation, new challenges, but, boyâthis is going to be difficult,â said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. âThere will presumably be SNAFUs along the way.âA lobbyist on tax issues put it to The Daily Beast another way: âItâs a perfect storm.âSupporters of the relief plan are in the somewhat awkward position of defending the billâs ambitious programs while acknowledging the strain those same programs are placing on the agency that is supposed to somehow make it all work.âItâs quite predictable that weâre going to be challenged moving forward, implementing this bill that is desperately needed,â said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who chairs a sub-panel of the House Oversight Committee with jurisdiction over the IRS. âWeâre asking the IRS, which is a tax collection and auditing agency, to become a benefit payment agency as well. Thatâs a big change. Thatâs quite a mission creep.âPostmaster General Plans More Mail Delays, Price HikesFew are expecting that the IRS will totally crash and burn in the coming months or become unable to carry out its key duties. But the widely-held suspicion is that it will simply move more slowly and that the quality of service to taxpayers will decrease.âWhatâs going to happen is that the IRS is good at doing whatever is the priority of the moment that has to be done, and then will therefore sacrifice something else,â said Charles Rossotti, a former IRS commissioner under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.What may go on the backburner, necessarily, are other important but less-urgent functions of the IRS, putting it on an even worse long-term footing. Experts are concerned that the agency will backslide in achieving its core mission of complianceâensuring people who owe taxes pay themâthan it was before. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig told lawmakers in February that the agency did not collect some $570 billion in taxes that were owed in 2019. A study that same year from the National Bureau of Economic Research found the so-called âtax gapâ could grow to $7.5 trillion over a decade.Democrats blame Republican cuts to the IRS budget for this sorry state of affairs. âRepublicans spent the last decade gutting the IRS, so the agency has struggled when it comes to enforcement and staffing,â said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the IRS.When they took the House majority in 2010, tea party Republicans practically reveled in slashing the IRS budget, which they viewed as emblematic of wasteful government spending. The emergence of the Affordable Care Actâa program the IRS essentially enforced due to the centrality of the lawâs tax penalty for not having health insuranceâmade it even more of a GOP target.Over the course of the decade, the IRS budget was cut by 20 percent, said Holtzblatt, and its workforce has been slashed by nearly a quarter since 2010. Modernization efforts have lagged: The agency relies on technology systems that were introduced in the John F. Kennedy administration. Even before the pandemic, these factors contributed to refund delays; President Donald Trump, whose first budget request called for $250 billion cuts to the IRS, eventually relented, asking for more money for tax enforcement in 2019.When the pandemic hit last year in the middle of tax filing season, the IRS had to process returns and refunds while figuring out how to issue the first round of stimulus checksâ170 million of themâincluded in the CARES Act. That effort was largely successful, but there were delays: As of October, 12 million Americans still had not gotten their checks. And by December, the IRS still had 1 million tax returns to process from 2019, well after the extended July 15 filing deadline.Outrage from Capitol Hill was so general that special hotlines that the IRS set up to deal with lawmaker complaints were totally overwhelmed, Rettig told Connollyâs committee in October.âWe had a phone line for Congress that got essentially overrun with the volumeâ¦. and then it was my bright idea to create an email box such that our folks could work it around the clock on emails received,â said Rettig. âWe received, I think, over a hundred thousand emails from a house.gov or senate.gov [email account]. And so my bright idea really overran us as well. But it was an effort to try to get there.âFor Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), who chairs the House Ways and Means subcommittee that oversees the IRS, the agencyâs situation is remarkably similar to that of another public institution suffering from structural issues exacerbated by the pandemic: the U.S. Postal Service. âItâs not like the IRS is running a fine-tuned machine here,â Pascrell told The Daily Beast. âThe IRS reminds me of the Post Office and how itâs run.âNow that they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Democrats are optimistic they can do more to get the IRS out of the hole with increased funding. The final year of the Trump administration even saw improvements; the IRS fiscal year 2021 budget increased by $409 million from 2020, for a total funding allotment of nearly $12 billion.In his statement to The Daily Beast, Wyden pointed out that the American Rescue Plan includes $2 billion to help the IRS implement various programs. âWe canât ask the IRS to do more and more and not provide adequate resources,â he said, adding, âthe solution here is not one-time funding.ââItâs much harder for the IRS to build the plane while flying it,â continued Wyden. âWe need sustained funding over the long-term so the IRS can build and maintain these systems over the long-term.âIn the short term, experts are confident that the IRS will promptly issue the next round of stimulus payments, having had two opportunities already to improve the process.Biden Signs Massive $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Bill Into LawBut the duty to help eligible taxpayers access a major tax break on their past unemployment benefits may be tricky. Many will have to amend tax returns they already filed, and the IRS will have to figure out how to help them to do it quickly and accurately. âI am hoping that since last Friday when this got announced, that the IRS and Treasury lawyers have been working nonstop on guidance to taxpayers on what to do,â said Holtzblatt. âItâs not any easier for the IRS if taxpayers are confused.âMany tax experts, like Holtzblatt, say itâs highly unusual for the government to change tax laws retroactively so late in the filing season. Despite all the converging challenges and the promise of delays, itâs unclear if the IRS will extend the tax filing deadline, as they did last year. âItâs a no-brainer to me,â said Pascrell. âThe passage of massive stimulus this week is a huge win for America, but part of the [IRS] responsibility, as well as the administrationâs, is to follow up and understand the consequences of what we enacted.âRossotti, the former IRS commissioner, told The Daily Beast the IRS has taken the position that an extension is ânot a good idea.ââIt does not simplify things to change the filing season,â he said. âAny taxpayer can get an extension... There is a whole system geared to a set of dates, it ripples through a lot of things.âWhatever the path ahead, it will not be an easy one for the IRS. Rettig is set to testify in front of the House Ways and Means Committee next week, and Pascrell said he âbetterâ have answers about how they plan to maintain adequate service to taxpayers.His colleague, Connolly, was not quite ready to heap blame on Congress for the situation. But he offered a reflection: Legislative bodies like Congress, he said, âdo not often pay attention to implementation and delivery. They believe when they passed the bill, they solved the problem.âRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Our findings are published in the new report: âCan Capitalism Lead a More Sustainable and Equitable Recovery?â

In yesterdayâs article, we shared five insights that are shaping the corporate responsibility profession. Now, we highlight the seven most impactful strategies leaders are making in 2021 to make businesses more responsible.

Be active at the board level

According to Tensie Whelan, Director of NYU Sternâs Center for Sustainable Business, âBoards are obstructing ESG â at their own peril. PWCâs 2020 Annual Corporate Directors Survey found only 38 percent of board members think ESG [environmental, social and governance] issues have a financial impact on a company. A main part of the problem is boards lack ESG expertise, according to a new study.â

Corporate responsibility leaders say they are working hard to build the business case to executives. Through their efforts, board members, can understand the importance of positioning corporate responsibility as essential for new markets, building goodwill with regulators, generating consumer trust, and boosting employee recruitment efforts. These same leaders say they are are also pushing for more ESG training such as Competent Board certification.

Build longer-term plans for your corporate responsibility strategy

As one corporate responsibility leader of an international company shared, âWe must start by asking... âwhat will [corporate responsibility] look like in 5 years?â Our new CEO has a vision for a âpurpose-driven organization,â and corporate responsibility is essential to showing our company contributes to the greater good.â

Less than 1 percent of publicly traded companies have a âchief sustainability officerâ or equivalent. While corporate responsibility leaders say they are busier than ever, they also reminded us that it is time to evangelize for the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals], setting audacious targets, and showing that this movement is, according to former Unilever CEO Paul Polman, âthe biggest business opportunity of all time.â

Be a strategic partner, not a pest

Some corporate responsibility leaders reported senior managers from HR, operations, innovation and other departments are approaching to help solve business problems. As a result, they are also gaining more human and financial resources to sustainability and corporate responsibility teams.

One leader said, âthe typical [corporate responsibility] role used to be to go around and pester people to volunteer and donate during particular days of services of specifically themed months. This is outdated. Days of service and giving campaigns are undemocratic and they entrench power dynamics, while releasing companies of their real responsibilities to all stakeholders.â Leaders said growing their functions and aligning more resources were not seen as pests, but actually as levers company wide.

Engage executives and turn them into heroes

Successful professionals in this space have executive support: financial, cultural and promotional. Some are discreet: Leaders with an active stance who fail to achieve earnings are more likely to be fired. Nevertheless, CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, Pamela Maynard from Avanade, and Kevin Johnson from Starbucks are tying growth goals and compensation to targets.

Most successful corporate responsibility leaders describe themselves as lobbying executives, convincing them to increase investments, rewarding them with more press and brand opportunities. As a recent McKinsey report revealed, this trend is evident in the fact that 181 U.S. CEOs have signed a statement committing themselves to a new understanding of companiesâ role within society.

The bottom line is that investing in employees, supporting communities and dealing ethically with suppliers are all crucial, in addition to securing shareholder value. Looking at the triple bottom line â people, planet and profit - is now mainstream, as well as socially responsible investment or ESG funds.

Invest in self-care

Times are uncertain, and many corporate responsibility budgets are at risk: Expectations have never been higher. Leaders with whom we spoke felt tired and isolated, yet understood it was their time to inspire change and were working harder than ever. Sustaining pressure is only possible with self-care, with investments made professionally and personally.

The takeaway here is to create communities of support with fellow leaders while making time to reinvigorate and protect yourself from burnout.

Embrace social enterprise

MovingWorlds Institute defines a social enterprise as âAn organization that utilizes business principles and highly ethical internal and equitable operations to solve social and environmental challenges through creation of sustainable revenue streams â while managing their own externalities and also influencing larger systems around it.â

Corporate leaders indicate that they are increasingly looking to partner with social enterprises to achieve sustainability and equity targets.

For example, SAP says it is committing 5 percent of its spending with social enterprises by 2025. The rapid rise of âBuy Socialâ and âBenefit Corporationsâ â organizations that certify social enterprises â are further proof of this sectorâs growth.

As one strategy executive shared with us, âCompanies are making bigger commitments on sustainability, equity, justice, and other social factors... Most donât know how to achieve thisâ¦ they will need to partner with a new type of enterprise, the social enterprise, which prioritizes and measures â sustainability, equity, and justice factors alongside profit. When these businesses with a social focus are integrated into supply and distribution chains, only then can corporations reach their increasingly audacious sustainability and equity commitments.â

Scale by educating and engaging employees

Regarding success, nearly 100 percent of interviewees shared that if they did their job well, corporate responsibility and sustainability would be integrated into all aspects of the business: Not just programmatically, but also with measurement, shared resources, strategic partnerships, and most importantly, an educated and active employee base.

As we have seen in our platform focused on sustainable growth of revenues for international development (S-GRID) with partners like SAP, when employees are educated on social responsibility, they in turn make many small decisions that can create more sustainable companies, including shifting spending to responsible suppliers, building more inclusive technologies, coding inequality and discrimination out of artificial intelligence and designing carbon-neutral products.

The future: integrating corporate responsibility into business

According to Bill Gates, âAs awful as this pandemic is, climate change could be worse.â Further, the World Economic Forumâs recent global risks report has suggested that the top five economic threats were environmental, as climate-change risks have become more real as they took a backseat to the more visible COVID pandemic.

Yet companies, like BlackRock, Microsoft and Amazon, have pledged to address climate change risks. These actions confirm that growth in corporate responsibility investments that started during the pandemic and ongoing calls for social justice during 2020, must continue and expand to do more. Corporate responsibility leaders will continue to be elevated to guide and lead these discussions â and by staying focused on these approaches, they will be able to increase their roleâs prominence and potency across all companies.

SHOW us the money! Evanston, IL! It is the first US city to pay cash reparations to its Black population. City has committed $10 million in payments to eligible Blacks, who will receive up to $25,000 for housing. Blacks who were victims of cityâs redlining policies, dating back to the 40s, will be among the first beneficiaries of the funds. Some funds to finance the reparation payments initiative will come from the 3% tax on legal marijuana sales. Itâs not much, but it is a good start.

Anthony Henderson



U.S. Marine Colonel Anthony Henderson, 53, is being promoted to 4-Star brigadier general which requires US Senate confirmation. A combat command marine deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, Henderson was overlooked 3x for this promotion since 2017. When confirmed, he becomes the first African American 4-star general in the Marine Corpâs 245 year history. He holds a law degree from Southern University Law School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

NEWSMAKERS

RIP: Vernon Jordan, 85, passed away last week. His was a storied life. Born in Jim Crow Georgia, he attended De Pauw University and Howard University in Washington, DC. A civil rights activist, a social justice advocate, attorney, investment banker, and power broker The National Urban League CEO, Jordan was the United Negro College Fund Executive Director, and NAACP field director. His impact was far reaching in the American social climate of the 60s. Charlayne Hunter-Gault wrote that she got a call from Jordan that she would have to leave Wayne State in Michigan to get ready to integrate the University of Georgia. Jordan practiced law in Arkansas and Georgia until he accepted a post at the prestigious Washington, DC law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer where he remained until his transition to New York to join Lazard Freres, the investing banking firm. Jordan also morphed into power broker extraordinaire, nationally and internationally. He sat on the Boards of American Express, Howard University, Xerox, Lazard Ltd and was best friend to President William Clinton. His memoir VERNON CAN READ is a good read about America at one of its intersections of race and social justice.

The Jordan funeral was held on March 9 and was streamed by National Urban League at nul.org/vernonjordan.

In other words, all that pageantry and costume wearing gets on the nerves when to you, it represents a history of invasion, killing, and forced starvation. It's curious that to Americans, there isn't a little of the same feeling, considering that we teach the Revolution in our schools and sing about the War of 1812 in our national anthem.

But there is some significance in the British monarchy to Americans. At the lowest, it is at the level of magazines about movie actors. At a real level, it is the history of the United States from before we were the U.S.

I recommend The Law of the Land by Charles Rembar (you would probably want to buy it used) to get a feel for how our current system developed over these past thousand years or so. How did the concept of justice develop, as embodied in our courts, the jury system, and even the concept of people having rights? It all goes back to British kings and queens, the infighting between the king and Parliament, and ultimately the development of (at least some) concept of universal human rights.

So, at the level of history, the British monarchy serves to remind us that it was a long, slow grind to rid ourselves of them. We ought to be celebrating our lack of a king.

And on top of that, we ought to be celebrating the fact that we rid ourselves of the entire aristocracy. Can you imagine if Donald Trump had inherited the presidency, would serve in it for life, and would then leave it to Donald Jr.?

The mind boggles. Yet that is the curse of the hereditary monarchy.

There is one other ultimately curious thing about this whole story of Meghan and, before her, Diana. In the entire United Kingdom and its 68 million people, there are only a few dozen people who have the social rank of royalty. There are a few dozen more who carry some hereditary rank of the aristocracy -- I hesitate to use the word ""nobility"" because it has taken on a different meaning in American English. That leaves the other 68 million to live the role of social underlings. They are all of them common. At least officially.

I prefer the social role conferred by the term American Citizen. It represents a condition of equality before the law -- and at least at some level -- the condition of social equality. It is true that snobbery exists in this country and there is a constant need among some groups to assert their social superiority, but it is countered by a parallel theme of the self-made-man (and now woman) who asserts his/her own superiority in the doing of things. The American theater and movies have made mockery of our self-appointed society people almost as long as they have existed.

I'm not going to get all weepy about Meghan, who has a boatload of money, an estate of her own, and has demonstrated that she could woo and win a prince. It makes for a story right out of Disney. But I suspect that the reality is that Meghan quickly realized that she used to be able to drive to Starbucks, go for a ride up the coast, go out to lunch, and chat with friends as she saw fit -- and all of that was suddenly denied to her. Imagine having to worry about obeying all the myriad rules as to what you can wear in public, when you can lift a fork at dinner, and what you can and cannot say. It would be interesting at first, but eventually it would wear on you.

As to the Oprah interview, if Meghan was making it all up it was an incredible performance. If not, it is a lesson not only for the Brits but for all of us. And then add the issue that the British are working through their own issues with racism, and that the problem exists within the aristocracy just as much as among the commoners.

What a word -- commoner -- with its multiple levels of meaning. Yet the British refer to their main legislative chamber as The House of Commons. Perhaps they will find another name for it sometime in the 22nd century.

One last thought on this topic. Back in 1929 the Soviet film industry was pushing out propaganda films to support the ongoing revolution. Some of them get shown at film festivals, so I got to see what is perhaps the masterwork of the genre. It is called (in English) Fragment of an Empire, referring to a term used by a former Bolshevik leader. Anyway, right near the end, the protagonist utters the words -- in total contempt -- ""Pathetic fragment of an empire."" I don't think the author of that phrase was thinking about European royalty, but it is what came to mind as I watched Harry and Meghan put the knife into the royal family. That's all there is to the royalty -- a historical pageant, a clown show, and a pathetic fragment of an empire.

Addendum

There was a comment to a previous article that suggested (at least that's my interpretation of the meaning) that the Covid relief bill (now signed!) was just a lot of wasted money. First of all thanks to those who take the time to comment. Second let's understand that there are those who would disagree entirely with that suggestion. Eric Levitz offers a summary of what he thinks are good things that will be accomplished by the bill. Taking children out of poverty is one of them. I will concede that to some people, this is a bug rather than a feature.

Speaking of real pork barrel, there is rumor that the Democrats are contemplating bringing back Earmarks. That is to say, pork. Individual congress members would be able to add projects of benefit to their own districts. (Maybe we could finally get the road fixed here in San Pedro -- you know, the road that disappeared during a coastal landslide a decade ago and was never replaced.)

The point is that even members of the minority party could partake of the pork. This was a method that helped to get bills passed in the old days. A Republican from western Nebraska or middle Alabama could tell the voters, ""Yeah, I voted for the bill, because it got us the highway bypass and the new post office."" It will be interesting to see whether Republican leaders in the House will be able to hold party discipline against earmarks, considering that they are going to lose every vote anyway.

Earmarks are not that foreign to the Republican Party anyway. Remember that Mitch McConnell bragged to his voters about getting a billion dollars for Kentucky into the budget. Maybe good old fashioned pork barrel is the way to generate some bipartisan enthusiasm.

On a sunny day in early 2017, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet Inc.'s chief executive officer, returned to his alma mater, the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, in West Bengal, to speak before 3,500 students. Welcomed as the ""rock star"" leader of the ""world's most innovative company,"" he reminisced about skipping classes and meeting his college girlfriend -- now his wife. He also pitched Google to the soon-to-be-graduates in attendance. How many wanted to work there, the interviewer asked. Hundreds of hands went up. ""Wow, maybe we should open a campus in Kharagpur,"" Pichai joked.

As far as feeder schools go, it doesn't get much better for Google than the network of 23 ultracompetitive, government-funded IITs. Every year hundreds of their graduates join the world's biggest tech companies. In 2003, when the school system celebrated its 50th anniversary, Bill Gates delivered a keynote speech praising grads who'd come to work at Microsoft Corp. over the years, noting that the company had, in turn, invested more money in the IITs than in any other institution outside the U.S. and the U.K.

For all the IITs' proficiency at training and placing students, though, the coders, programmers, product developers, and engineers fanning out to global tech bring with them the troubled legacy of India's caste system. On campus, students are surrounded by-- and in some cases participate in -- a culture of discrimination, bullying, and segregation that targets fellow pupils from India's Scheduled Castes, also known as Dalits. The IITs officially discourage such harassment, but the prejudice against these students remains quite open.

Caste in India speaks, as race does in America, to centuries of social, cultural, and economic divisions. Unlike in the U.S., though, India has since 1950 had a national system of affirmative action designed to undo the legacy of bias. Among its provisions are ones that help Dalits and other oppressed groups get into and pay for college. For nearly half a century, IIT admissions have been subject to a reservation system that's still hotly debated on the campuses. In recent years, the schools have opposed attempts to extend affirmative action to faculty hires, arguing it would dilute the quality of the applicant pool and undermine their meritocratic image.

The IITs are notoriously cutthroat, starting with the admissions process. Some 2.2 million people have registered to take the 2021 entrance exam, to vie for roughly 16,000 slots. About 15% of those are allotted to students from the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and another 7.5% to applicants from the Scheduled Tribes (STs), indigenous people who've faced marginalization and whose status has also been formalized by the constitution. To fill those slots, universities sometimes offer seats to students with test scores below the cutoff point -- though not as far below as is commonly assumed.

Caste-based resentment at the IITs can run high. In one video posted on YouTube in 2018, a student poring over a pile of books is labeled ""GEN,"" for general pool, while the two students sleeping nearby are identified as ""SC"" and ""ST."" In another post circulated widely among IIT groups last year, a student suggested Covid-19 should also give preferential treatment to the marginalized groups. ""My dear Corona,"" it said in Hindi. ""In every sphere SC/STs get first preference. So if you can, please look into the same.""

Dalit IIT graduates who've managed to land jobs in the U.S. say that such attitudes can be found there, too. Last year a Dalit graduate of IIT Bombay filed suit in the U.S. against Cisco Systems Inc. and two of his fellow alums, saying he'd experienced caste-based discrimination at their hands while the three of them were employed at the company. The accompanying publicity prompted a wave of complaints about caste discrimination in American tech -- allegations that seemed to blindside the industry.

Amit Jatav, a Dalit from Karauli, in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, remembers catching ""the IIT bug"" in high school, where he excelled in chemistry, physics, and math. His father, an elementary school teacher, and his mother, a fieldworker, scraped together money from relatives and local lenders to send him for a year of test prep. He took the entrance exam in 2017 and got into IIT Delhi on his first try.

Jatav's classmates quickly identified him as Dalit. He'd been educated in Hindi-language schools, and his English was poor. His clothes were worn and shabby. He didn't have a smartphone. In an environment where entrance exam scores are status symbols, Jatav had placed relatively low, marking him as a ""quota"" student. He heard loud comments saying he was at IIT only because of his ""category"" instead of ""earning it rightfully."" He wasn't invited to study groups, dinners, or social events.

""I struggled with my studies, but nobody helped,"" says Jatav, now 21 and in his final year. ""The attitude was: He's a Dalit, let him struggle.""

The caste system traces as far back as ancient India. It comprises four core strata, with the Dalits lying outside and below. (The word ""Dalit,"" in classical Sanskrit, means ""broken."") These divisions still permeate life for many Indians, dictating how they work and worship, eat and marry, own land and vote. More than 200 million of the country's 1.3 billion people are classified as Dalits.

In the 1920s, Mahatma Gandhi fought to eradicate practices separating Dalits from others, such as preventing them from entering Hindu temples. After independence in 1947, India's first minister of law and justice, Dalit campaigner B.R. Ambedkar, wrote recompense into the constitution he helped draft. The move banned discrimination based on caste and guaranteed the government's ability to secure representation and unlock opportunity for people who'd lacked both for centuries. India introduced an affirmative action program in 1950; within a few years it was reserving seats in colleges for oppressed Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, a practice it extended to the IITs in 1973. (An exception is made for ""the creamy layer,"" the official term for lower-caste people who've managed to achieve high status and economic security, who aren't eligible for the quota system.)

Despite this, coded and overt forms of discrimination against Dalits persist, with the education system serving as a primary vector. At secondary school in Rajasthan, Mahesh Kumar recalls, he and his father swept the classrooms as a condition of Kumar's scholarship; they were expected not to make contact with the teachers' belongings so as not to taint them. When Kumar gained admission to IIT (BHU) Varanasi in 2013, he tried to obscure his caste status by dropping his last name, but it didn't help. At the beginning of an IIT school year, senior students often orchestrate a hazing ritual known as kholna, calling on first-year students to give their name, their hometown, and the rank they achieved on the entrance exam. If a surname isn't a giveaway, an unusual rank on the entrance exam will be.

Another Dalit, Akshit Sangomla, says that in his first year at IIT Kanpur he refused to reveal his rank. It got out anyway, and soon seniors began stopping him to grill him on his engineering knowledge. Sangomla, who was living away from home for the first time, remembers being terrified by the badgering. He also found himself, like Jatav at IIT Delhi, left out of study groups, dinners, and celebrations. His confidence shot, he struggled academically, falling into a vicious cycle that led to his expulsion after five semesters. ""As a Dalit you'll always be an outsider,"" says Sangomla, who now works as a journalist at a magazine based in New Delhi.

Only one IIT out of the dozen Bloomberg Businessweek contacted for this story -- including Delhi, Bombay, Kharagpur, (BHU) Varanasi, Madras, and Kanpur -- responded to repeated requests for comment made by email and phone over several months. Many of the schools have appointed liaison officers to look into caste discrimination on campus; they didn't respond to requests for comment either. A representative of one school said on background that the IITs didn't want to get drawn into a ""controversial"" topic. The only formal response came from IIT Roorkee, which said it hadn't received any caste-based discrimination complaints in the past five years. ""The reservation policy has helped, without exacerbating caste based discrimination,"" a spokesperson wrote.

In a 2016 survey of students at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, World Bank economist Priyanka Pandey and her brother, activist Sandeep Pandey, found that Dalits not only experience more discrimination and negativity than others, but their academic performance is also lower, even after controlling for different socioeconomic backgrounds. Asked about the gap, a majority of respondents attributed it to the ""lower ability"" of lower-caste students. ""Caste and class run parallel at the IITs, which are a microcosm of Indian society,"" says Sandeep, who holds a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley and has taught social justice classes at IITs. ""For Dalits, life on the campus is a daily reminder of who they are.""

A 2020 graduate of IIT Guwahati's design program, Agrata Patel, got into the school through a separate but parallel quota system for students from ""other backwards classes,"" or OBCs -- historically oppressed groups that are covered by the reservation system but aren't Scheduled Castes or Tribes. Patel says that, though she faced special pressure as someone from a reserved category, it was easier for her than for her Dalit friends and classmates. ""It's a huge load on them. People are always judging them,"" she says. ""I felt for them, I still feel for them. My grades were good -- nobody got a chance to point a finger at me."" That track led her to her current job, at an Australian tech company.

Dalits in the IIT system often have a rougher path to employment. After his first few semesters in Varanasi, Kumar fell into a deep depression and took time off from school. Overwhelmed by debt, he considered bidding for a sewer-cleaning contract that paid 4,000 rupees ($55) a month. The social hierarchy that considers Dalits ""impure"" consigns them to poorly paid, ""unclean"" jobs such as scavenging, cleaning sewers, and disposing of dead animals. Kumar even considered selling a kidney.

Then came a stroke of good fortune. A local paper reported that an IIT student was considering sewer cleaning and organ donation, prompting an outpouring of donations. Kumar returned to Varanasi and graduated in 2019. He now works as an assistant manager with a government-owned mining company in the eastern city of Durgapur.

There's no reliable data on IIT student placement rates or professional salaries, but anecdotal evidence suggests the grind is worth it for many. In December, when students traditionally begin receiving job offers, news outlets relay how quickly they're coming in, and schools boast of how many graduates will make 10 million rupees or more.

In a 2017 paper, French researchers Odile Henry and Mathieu Ferry found that not all IIT graduates are greeted by such an enthusiastic job market. Lower-caste students were barely half as likely to get jobs as general-pool students with similar majors and academic performance; they were also paid less. The researchers attributed the difference primarily to a divide between Dalit and non-Dalit students in soft skills and social capital. In the lucrative private sector, recruiters look beyond grades for candidates who demonstrate curiosity, leadership, poise, or a competitive spirit -- qualities that might show up in, say, extracurricular activities, a glowing recommendation from a teacher, or simply a student's confidence in an interview.

""If one of the criticisms of the quota policy is its lack of meritocracy, since it encourages students whose educational outcomes are lower,"" the authors wrote, ""we note here that it is reserved groups that suffer unequal treatment for equal academic success.""

Last year, allegations of caste bias got a public airing some 8,300 miles away from the IIT campuses. On behalf of the Indian Cisco Systems employee who alleged he'd been discriminated against based on his caste, California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing brought a suit in San Jose against the company and two other Indian employees. All three were graduates of IIT Bombay.

American law protects workers from disparate treatment based on a handful of characteristics, including race, sex, religion, and disability status. This was the first time, though, that anyone had argued those protections should extend to Dalits. The complaint said that the unnamed employee had faced discrimination by two upper-caste managers since 2015 and that he'd reported one to human resources for outing him as a Dalit and informing colleagues he'd enrolled in the IIT through affirmative action. The employee said the discrimination had continued under the second manager.

Cisco denied the charges. ""We have zero tolerance for discrimination and take all complaints of unfair treatment very seriously,"" a spokesperson says. ""In this case, we thoroughly and fully investigated the employee's concerns and found that he was treated fairly, highly compensated, and afforded opportunities to work on coveted projects."" In its response to the suit, Cisco made an additional argument: Because caste isn't a protected category under U.S. civil rights laws, the allegations are immaterial and should be stricken. The court recently denied Cisco's petition to move the case to arbitration, and the company has filed an appeal.

Advocacy groups in the U.S. have weighed in on both sides. The Hindu American Foundation filed a declaration in support of Cisco, saying that though it vehemently opposes ""all forms of prejudice and discrimination,"" the state's case ""blatantly violates the rights of Hindu Americans."" Meanwhile, the Ambedkar International Center, a Dalit advocacy group, filed a brief in support of the state, encouraging the court to acknowledge caste discrimination and set a precedent prohibiting it. ""American civil rights law has little experience with the Indian caste system, but it is very familiar with the idea of caste: the notion that some people are born to low stations in life in which they are forced to remain,"" the motion reads.

The case inspired a flood of tech workers to tell their own stories. A U.S.-based Dalit advocacy group, Equality Labs, told the Washington Post in October that more than 250 tech workers had come forward in the wake of the Cisco suit to report incidents of caste-based harassment. Thirty Dalit engineers, all women, also shared a joint statement with the Post that said they'd experienced caste bias in the U.S. tech sector.

For years the industry has been criticized for doing too little to rectify a culture seen as hostile to women, Black people, and Latinos. In response, companies have held town halls, instituted anti-harassment training, and made very public promises to do better. On caste, though, executives have largely pleaded ignorance. Microsoft is a rare exception: The company, whose CEO, Satya Nadella, is Indian-American, says that it's received a few complaints of caste bias and that it has more work to do. Google, for its part, says it will investigate any discrimination claims based on caste; it wouldn't say whether it had received any, and Pichai didn't respond to Businessweek's requests for comment.

Another Indian-American executive, Shantanu Narayen, has been CEO at Adobe Inc. since 2007. The company employs hundreds of Indian expats, including more than 100 who graduated from an IIT. In an interview with Bloomberg TV last year, Narayen, a graduate of an engineering school (though not an IIT) in his native Hyderabad, rejected the idea that any of Adobe's Indian workers might show bias based on caste. What the company ""has always stood for and our founders instituted as the way of creating this company is equality for all,"" he said. ""We have not had any of those issues.""

It would be naive for U.S. companies to assume that Indian hires leave their prejudices on the subcontinent, says Sarit K. Das, a professor of mechanical engineering at IIT Madras who until February was director of IIT Ropar. ""Graduates carry this to Amazon or Google or wherever, and the feeling toward the other person is that you didn't make it like me, you are inferior,"" he says.

Ram Kumar, a Dalit alum of IIT Delhi, has worked in the tech industry for more than two decades, with stints at Cisco, Dell, and other companies. When he arrived in Silicon Valley in the early 2000s, he found ""another mini-India arranged by clusters of Indian hierarchy,"" he says. Whereas dominant-caste Indians might see expat communities as sources of professional networking and support, Kumar avoids them. ""People will try to segregate you once they find out your caste,"" he says. As a matter of self-preservation, ""I've avoided good opportunities when I see that the CEO or CTO is Indian.""

Back in India, Dalit students, faculty, and allies have been pushing back against discrimination. When IIT Bombay tried in 2018 to establish a separate dining hall for meat eaters -- a proxy for lower-caste students, since many in the upper castes are vegetarian -- student groups protested and got the move quashed, along with a rule at another dining hall that required meat eaters to use separate plates and cutlery. Opposition ended a similar effort at IIT Madras to force nonvegetarian students to use separate entrances, exits, and hand-washing stations.

Professors are also speaking out. Although the IITs are government institutions, reservation requirements don't apply to faculty positions. More than 90% of the 6,000 faculty the system employs are from the dominant castes, a lopsidedness that reflects the populations of the schools' Ph.D. programs, which aren't subject to quotas either. Earlier this year, government data showed that 15 of the 31 departments at IIT Delhi and 16 of 26 at IIT Bombay admitted zero students from the Scheduled Castes to their doctoral programs last year. ""I have chaired hundreds of faculty selection committees, and the discrimination against Dalits is never overt. It's always about the attitude toward the candidates, the questions asked, and the judgment,"" says Das. ""We follow the rules in the letter but not in spirit.""

In 2018, Subrahmanyam Saderla, a Ph.D. graduate of IIT Kanpur, was selected as an assistant professor in the school's aerospace engineering department, becoming one of about 150 Dalit faculty in the IIT system. He'd applied for the position through a special drive to recruit Scheduled Caste & Tribe faculty. In a later hearing before the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Saderla said that, once he was on staff, senior faculty members called him ""unsuitable and mentally unfit,"" undermined him with junior colleagues and students, and suggested his appointment was a curse on the institute. The Commission directed the school to bring the matter to the police; the police complaint named four professors, all of whom denied the accusations against them.

Within months, Saderla was anonymously accused of plagiarizing his work on unmanned aircraft systems, a charge that could have led to his dismissal and the revocation of his doctorate. ""They are OK if you are a clerk in the office or a junior technician,"" he says. ""But even if you are good enough, you can't be a faculty member."" He thought he'd escaped the caste system, only to find that he couldn't.

Hundreds of global scholars, academics, and activists came out in solidarity with Saderla, signing a statement condemning the alleged discrimination and institutional harassment. Saderla was absolved of the plagiarism charge, and after a year-and-a-half-long court battle, his colleagues were exonerated of the caste-discrimination charges. He's appealing the latter decision to India's Supreme Court. ""If you are born with this tag,"" he says, ""it stays with you until you die.""

With cases such as this and the Cisco suit, civil-rights advocates see evidence of progress toward addressing the legacy of caste bias. ""The critical mass of students who have come in through reservations has made it more difficult to marginalize them,"" says Ajantha Subramanian, chair of Harvard's anthropology department and the author of a book on caste discrimination at the IITs. ""They are a force to contend with.""

On creating space in oneâs industry

Roshni Mahtani

âBabysitting in New York, I crossed paths with a toddler who was so curious about everything, including where I came from. I wanted to find out if I could feed her durian and the answers just werenât available online back then. I realised that all the information mums in Asia were getting were culturally irrelevant. I saw a space, took it, and the rest is history.â â Roshni Mahtani

Huili Guo

âI hope that one day we will progress enough such that a female in a leadership position in science isnât automatically a poster girl, because that would mean female science leaders wonât be such a rarity. Younger batches need role models to look up to so that they know that working in STEM is a viable career option, even with children.â â Dr. Huo Guili

On leading in the workplace

Renyung Ho

âI feel strongly that a female leader should be seen simply as a leader, and not held to different standards just because of her gender. Qualities that define good leadership are no different for anyone: articulating a common vision, standing up for what matters, being both fair and firm where required, and bringing people along with you.â â Ho Ren Yung

Ruth Yam

âBe yourself. Never be afraid to speak your mind or worry that your views may differ from others. Trust yourself. Lead with both your head and heart.â â Ruth Yam, Marketing and Category Director, Starbucks

On believing in oneâs capabilities

Angelene Chan

Women are often too hard on ourselves. We feel the need to take on everything yet we feel guilty when we drop a ball or two. We are our worst critics. I think it is time we stopped going against ourselves. As women, we need to start taking our own side for once. Be our own cheerleaders, our own heroines. We need to trust that we are made for greater things, know that we can affect change and impact lives, understand that we have a choice, and step up. CEO or not, we need to be a leader in our own right and in our own place. â Angelene Chan

Halimah Yacob

â(I prefer to be known not by my gender.) People should be assessed based on their abilities to contribute, their track record and what they can do to benefit Singapore and Singaporeans. Men, women, it doesnât matter, because there must be the desire and the passion to serve â that is the most important.â â Halimah Yacob

On achieving work-life balance

Be present. At work, focus on the job at hand; at home, put work aside and focus on family. â Angelene Chan

(Work-life balance) is not a weighing scale. Let go of the notion that one tips in favour of the other. Balance can also mean harmony. Thatâs what you should strive for. â Roshni Mahtani

Antiki Bose

The challenges women face are different from men. Most struggle with expectations of managing their home and children versus what theyâre expected to do at work. So, managers and coaches keep that in mindâit is incredibly important that thereâs empathy for the expectations that women have to meet. â Ankiti Bose

Ho Lee Yen

Donât let anyone tell you to choose between work and family. Be clear of your priorities, and make time for them. Over time, with consistency, it will become a habit and youâll notice the positive effects on your health and happiness. â Ho Lee Yen, Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, AIA Singapore

Heather Harpham's BURNING

7:30pm, Wednesday, March 17

Hosted by Gail Schickele

The Marsh continues its Women's History Month celebration throughout March with Heather Harpham's highly kinetic, semi-comic romp about climate change, BURNING. Using movement, song, monologue, and other otherworldly images - from Hurricane Sandy to apocalyptic movie references, NPR's narcoleptic effect, and the countless trivial tasks that preoccupy the world while Rome burns - this work roams through the absurd landscapes of climate change where comedy, tragedy, activism, and cautious optimism collide. Following the performance, Harpham will join Solo Arts Heal host to discuss raising awareness around this issue, encouraging changes in attitude and behavior that will help our world move towards adapting to climate change related trends.

Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, Heather Harpham is a writer and theater artist now based in New York. Her work has been presented at venues across the US and internationally, including the Kathmandu International Theater Festival in Nepal and the NOTAFE Festival in Estonia. Harpham's 2017 memoir, Happiness: The Crooked Little Road to Semi-Ever After, was featured as a Reese Witherspoon Bookclub selection, chosen for Barnes and Noble's Discover Great New Writers Series, included on the ""Indie Next Pick"" list by the American Booksellers Association, and is currently being adapted for the screen. Her writing has been recognized with the Brenda Ueland Prose Prize, a Marin Arts Council Independent Artist Grant, support from the Barbara Deming Memorial Fund for Women, and a New York Innovative Theater Award nomination. Harpham has taught as a guest artist at colleges and universities throughout the US and in Europe, and currently advises in the MFA Writing Program at Sarah Lawrence College.

Jackson Nogahl's The Rain Delay

7:30pm, Wednesday, March 24

Hosted by Rick Davis

Inspired to provide support for others, The Marsh launches a new monthly program relationship with AnCan, the first virtual, real time audio/visual peer-to-peer support group platform. Designed for every serious disease and condition, AnCan removes all barriers for widespread participation, especially to those geographically, physically, or socially disadvantaged. AnCan Founder Rick Davis will begin hosting Solo Arts Heal every fourth Wednesday of the month. The debut features guest Jackson Nogahl, who will be performing an excerpt performance of The Rain Delay. Chronicling his first day back to work after prostate surgery, this work weaves together the lessons of a 1990s skateboarder, tallboy beers, Clydesdale horses, a magic trick, the power of prayer, the most beautiful woman in the office, and above all else, Mother Nature. Following his performance, Nogahl joins Davis to discuss the importance of connectivity, especially for those living with serious diseases and conditions. Nogahl celebrated his ten-year anniversary with prostate cancer on Valentine's Day 2021, and has been finding humor in his experiences living with this condition as he writes his memoir War and Pee. Nogahl began to develop his stories for a live audience in 2020 and was set to perform The Rain Delay onstage when COVID-19 hit. He adapted the story for Story Lab Chicago's first Zoom performance.

After the performance, Lennon joins the Solo Arts Heal hosts for a post-performance Q&A.

For more than 25 years, Gabrielle Lennon has worked as a professional actress on stage and in film, and as a published writer in multiple genres.

After the performance, Rush joins the Solo Arts Heal hosts for a post-performance Q&A to discuss rape culture, toxic masculinity, the origins of sexual inequality, and ultimately inspires productive ways for both men and women to effect change.

Joanna Rush is an actor, playwright, dancer, author, and interfaith minister. After enduring multiple sexual assaults, Rush sought a deeper understanding of the root causes of sexual violence.

The general consensus? It's the best thing the chain has released since the Salted Caramel Cream Cold Brew. I mean, I'm not really surprised, are you? Starbucks is known for constantly reinventing the wheel of caffeinated iced drinks, and even when I placed my order, the barista said, ""Good choice; but fair warning, this drink is very easy to get addicted to."" Now consider this my warning to you.

The drink is a new addition to Starbuck's permanent nationwide menu and features Oatly's plant-based oat milk, a nondairy milk alternative. I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to see what all the fuss is about and whether it's worth the almost six bucks.

What's in the Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso?

The ingredient list for Starbucks's Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso is as lengthy and complicated as the name. A grande includes three shots of Starbucks's signature Blonde espresso shaken with four pumps of brown sugar syrup, topped with a heavy splash of Oatly's oat milk and a few shakes of cinnamon powder. There's a lot going on, but it all comes together for a deliciously looking iced-coffee hue.

What Does It Taste Like?

One sip, and you'll see why this iced shaken espresso is turning heads. It is refreshingly sweet yet packs a strong punch of caffeine. I was a little apprehensive that the grande, which comes with three shots, would be too strong for me (the last thing I wanted was the uncomfortable caffeine jitters). My barista recommended toning it down to two espresso shots, and I'm so glad she did! I didn't taste an overwhelming amount of espresso, but it also didn't taste like I was drinking straight sugar.

I will say, make sure to stir or give your drink an extra shake before taking your first sip. Because the oat milk gets poured last, most of the espresso sinks to the bottom.

Is It Worth Ordering?

As someone who's a big fan of Starbucks's Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew (top that baby with vanilla sweet cream cold foam, and you'll be in coffee heaven), I was really excited to try this new brown sugar iced espresso. And since my best friend didn't have anything but positive things to say, I figured I had to like it, right? Hell yeah, I did.

It's strong yet sweet but not too sweet, and it's a pleasant change from my boring, typical iced coffee with half and half routine. Not to mention, it's only 120 calories and 13 grams of sugar (a grande vanilla latte is 250 calories and 35 grams of sugar, for reference). If you find the drink a little too strong, like me, or sweet, you can always kindly ask your barista to adjust the number of espresso shots or pumps of syrup. The next time you're craving a refreshing iced beverage that'll also give you a bolt of energy, I'd definitely recommend hitting up your closest Starbucks to order one.",,,0.998639047,0.0,positive,"Starbucks released newest cold coffee beverage, Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, earlier month, immediately coffee-lovers talking.

Master carver Sanford Williams is well known among art circles across Canada. His carvings adorn the walls of notable institutions world over. He not only comes from a lineage of renowned carvers, but his people â the Mowachaht First Nation from Yuquot (Friendly Cove) on the west coast of Vancouver Island â have a rich 4,000-year-old history. Yuquot is where Captain James Cookâs arrived in 1778 and âfirst contactâ is recorded between Europeans and Vancouver Island First Nations. But that legacy is brought crumbling down every time Sanford faces discrimination â which has been a steady reality throughout his life. And every instance has made him relive the trauma of his time at residential school, the sexual and physical abuse he endured there and the centuries of mistreatment that his people have witnessed through colonization. Since he was a young man, employees at retail outlets have followed him around in stores to make sure that heâs not âstealingâ or intoxicated. When he is out his wife Marlana â who is not First Nations â servers and clerks either ignore or hassle him, and question his ability to make a purchase until Marlana drifts to his side. Sanford is now 54, but he has never retaliated nor spoken out against the discrimination. This is a trait he says he shares with many other residential school survivors in Canada who either âshrug it offâ or âlearned to deal with it.â âI didnât know how to speak up,â he said, adding that he always ended up feeling like a âreally bad person.â Itâs a feeling that constantly follows him around mostly in cities. On the west coast of Vancouver Island, he is most comfortable with his family and friends â First Nations or not â without being judged. âBut when I leave that environment, I can feel the change right away.â Sanford silently burns inside with hurt and anger at the way society treats Indigenous people. He only began venting about it, when he met Marlana, who over the years helped him articulate and speak out these feelings. âHe wonât say anything but in his mind heâs thinking, âI am not a drunk, Iâm a world-class artist, why are you treating me like Iâm beneath you when you donât even know the person I am?â she said. Marlana said that as a âwhite woman married to an Indigenous manâ, although she is not the one experiencing racism she feels the ripple effect of it, especially when her husband is mistreated. On social media, ignorant people take every excuse to perpetrate racism against First Nations, she said. âThey try to find a way to explain their racism without saying that theyâre racist.â In a recent altercation on social media, Marlana recieved flak for defending Sanford and his family in a conversation about the poor quality of drinking water in First Nation communities. She said commentators refused to acknowledge the racism in their statements instead calling her a âliberalâ and adding âeverything triggers you.â Both Sanford and Marlana want people to research and go back to history before they propagate stereotypes and misconceptions. But sometimes asking the crowd to research and look at the full picture also backfires. ""They see it as an insult as nobody likes to be told that the donât have all the information,"" said the couple. Those who make discriminatory remarks are ignorant about the cruelty of the past and the ongoing issues that First Nations communities continue to face. âThe problem is that too many people are touting free speech, or using that as an excuse to say hurtful things,â said Sanford. Those who racially profile natives as drunkards, donât realize that many Indigenous people historically resorted to alcoholism to cope with the trauma inflicted on them in residential schools, he said. Thereâs a need for more constructive dialogues between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, said Marlana and added that people entering these dialogues must exercise caution. âThere are a lot of First Nations people that were abused in residential school and they donât have the communication skills. They have got it all in their mind and they want to let it out but donât know how.â If the other side joins this conversation with fixed opinions and without the intention to listen and understand,itâs meaningless, she said.

Three semesters. One atypical year.

March 11 marks the first anniversary of when COVID-19 ââ a deadly virus sweeping the world ââ shut down our campus. On that day in 2020, UF President Kent Fuchs emailed students notifying them that all classes would be online starting March 16 and encouraging them to leave town. It was a moment that would change the course of the next year, and for many, their entire college experience.

With scheduled in-person graduations and widespread vaccine promises, UF administration is beginning to discuss a return to normalcy.

But nearly 250 people in Alachua County have died with COVID-19 complications, according to The New York Times. Grandparents hugged their grandchildren through plastic tarps; life milestones were reduced to drive-thru services; and people died alone after exchanging final goodbyes over FaceTime. No matter what life looks like post-pandemic, one thing is certain: Those who perished wonât be here to see it.

Students have altered their lives to follow social distancing protocols, stressed over online classes and attended club meetings over Zoom. Outside the classroom, they missed packing Saturdays in The Swamp, crossing the stage in a cap and gown, loading buses to formals and spending Starbucks-fueled all-nighters in the library. A year later, UF students reflect on the impact of the past year. While some talk about their return to an empty campus, others explain how their college memories have been confined to computer screens and kitchen tables.

Lily Olsthoorn

Julia Cooper Photo of Lily Oslthoorn.

Lily Olsthoorn shaved her head during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was an eventful time in her life, she said. In the homestretch of her high school senior year, she was waiting on college decisions, preparing for a water polo competition and dealing with a breakup â all while the world was entering a global pandemic.

âThe pandemic was pretty much a catalyst for a lot of healing. Even though it's the opposite of what you'd expect, I feel like I'm giving myself more chances for my mental health to get better,â the 19-year-old UF undeclared freshman said. âSo overall, I'd say it's been positive for me.â

Olsthoornâs two older brothers are UF alumni, and she remembers the energy of the school when she visited them here five years ago. The memory is preserved in her head as a reminder of the way things used to be, but she canât fathom experiencing the UF that way herself.

âIn the last couple months, I've been really trying so hard to meet people,â Olsthoorn said. âAnd I feel like I've gotten a little bit better at talking one-on-one, but when I'm going to be back in like a big social setting, I won't know how to act just because it's been so long.â

Melody Palmer

Melody Palmer remembers standing in line for Chipotle when she read an email from UF informing students classes would transition online. She remembered thinking if all classes would end up online, she would just go home to Port Orange, Florida.

While home, the 20-year-old UF sustainability studies sophomore lived with her 97-year-old grandfather. Due to her grandfather being at increased risk, she was cautious about leaving the house for his safety and avoided it as much as possible.

âI think I've lost a lot of respect for some people during the pandemic, just by seeing the people who like to go out,â Palmer said. âI don't know if I can view you in the same way.â

Alexandra Quintana

Julia Cooper Photo of Alexandra Quintana.

Alexandra Quintana said the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed her to take a break from being stuck in a routine and reflect on herself and the world around her.

âI feel like Iâm a completely different person,â Quintana, a 19-year-old UF political science sophomore, said. âI feel like we all are. I feel like thereâs no way we could be the same after that.â

After they were sent home from UF, she and her friend Gabrielle Adekunle created Take Action Florida, where she is currently the vice president. The lobbying organization, which focuses on education and activism on different social issues, will focus on gender and sexuality issues for Womenâs History Month.

âI feel like that's why the movement like the Black Lives Matter movement picked up when it did because we were all just really empathetic and understanding at that time,â Quintana said. âWe had nothing else to do but sit down and listen.â

Isabela Martinez-Moure

Isabela Martinez-Moure remembers waking up with heavy breathing after having nightmares that she hadnât graduated from high school.

âI was lacking closure so much that my brain couldnât process that I was done,â the 19-year-old UF business administration freshman said.

As a high school senior, she was very involved, working on events for student government and leading as captain of her schoolâs sailing team. She regrets never saying goodbye to her teachers and coaches.

Martinez-Moure never imagined how the pandemic would change the vision she had of her life in college. She said she had a hard time transitioning from her close relationships with people in Miami to involving herself with new people and activities at UF.

âIt was definitely hard going from such a tight-knit community where people know you for who you are to coming to a new school where the reality is, unless you get involved, you're just a number,â she said.

Ben Whitman

Ben Whitman, a 20-year-old UF industrial engineering sophomore, said the COVID-19 pandemic hasnât affected him as much as it has other people.

âI still do my normal stuff like going out with my friends,â he said. âIâm not totally changing my life.â

Although he wishes he could meet more people, Whitman said he enjoys scuba diving with Gator Scuba Club and participating in outdoor activities hosted by Outdoor Adventure Recreation, such as canoeing and hiking.

Alesha Wallen

Julia Cooper Photo of Alesha Wallen.

During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Alesha Wallen itched for a dramatic style change.

Lockdown allowed her to go through a transformation that increased her confidence in her appearance, she said. She updated her wardrobe and put together a skincare routine that made her complexion better than ever.

âI remember when the pandemic first started, I would just sit in front of my mirror, get ready and put on clothes just to feel good,â the 18-year-old UF biology freshman said.

Although Wallen said she made an effort to improve her style, her motivation for school tanked and now social situations feel draining.

âI think I've become more introverted where Iâve become unable to talk to people in class and bad at starting conversations,â she said.

Wallen said the social anxiety she developed over the COVID-19 pandemic has become so overwhelming that she canât imagine how she will adapt when all classes are in person and she will have to attend large lecture hall classes.

âOne of the biggest changes for me was the difference between last semester and this semester in the number of people on campus,â she said. âLike the change was so crazy for me walking around and seeing more people, like when I go to Starbucks and have to wait in an actual line.""

Everett Schwieg

Julia Cooper Photo of Everett Schwieg.

When UF first announced its campus shut down, Everett Schwieg was excited to take a break from his sophomore year spring semester.

âA year ago, we didnât imagine that the pandemic would be still going on,â the 20-year-old UF biomedical engineering junior said. âIt was a little more lighthearted at the time.â

A lot has changed for him since then â he finds himself spending more time alone than before. Schwieg said he feels like online classes have made the past year especially lonely.

âGoing to class and meeting up with people after was very natural. I didn't feel like I was having to push myself to go out,â he said. âBut now I'm always trying to push myself to not sit in my room all day.â

With one year left at UF, Schwieg hopes he will return to having more in-person classes.

âIâve never been a huge fan of online learning, even before COVID,â he said. âI liked having a routine and attending my classes.â

Renier Rodriguez

Julia Cooper Photo of Renier Rodriguez.

This past year has made Renier Rodriguez more grateful for his supportive friend group.

Two weeks ago, he texted a friend and fellow UF student that he was feeling alone. On Friday, they decided to catch up with each other on a walk around Turlington Plaza.

âIt's been really motivating to see that people are there for you,â the 20-year-old UF political science sophomore said. âAnd itâs great to find motivation within yourself to do your own things that you actually want to do.â

After the COVID-19 pandemic started, Rodriguez immediately went home to South Florida to help his family. He took care of his little brothers for his mom, who is an essential health care worker. When his family contracted COVID-19, he found it hard to help them and maintain his studies at the same time.

Rodriguez also said he misses the team sports he participated in his freshman year. He played basketball and volleyball competitively and soccer and football recreationally at UF before the pandemic.

During the start of the pandemic, Rodriguez took a sports hiatus. However, he became insecure about his weight gain. Now, he tries to visit the park when itâs empty to shoot some hoops by himself or with a small group of friends.

âPhysical activity is my relief,â he said. âI started doing individual exercises because I just couldn't deal with it anymore. It was affecting my mental health as well.â

Cameron Johnston

Julia Cooper Photo of Cameron Johnston.

When Cameron Johnston pictured his college years back in high school, he imagined walking around a busy campus and attending giant lecture halls alongside hundreds of people.

However, like many others, Johnston did not get the college freshman year he imagined for so long.

âIt was so unexpected,â the 18-year-old UF nuclear engineering freshman said. âMy whole year was online and didnât have any in-person classes. I never went to any clubs. I never went to any parties. I didn't get to hang out.â

Johnston said he wants a real college experience, but any return to normalcy would probably begin with a gradual shift.

âI think the impact of people being socially distanced and wearing masks sometimes in public might stick around,â he said. âSome people just might never feel comfortable going back.â

On March 5, Gov. Ned Lamont signed an act, Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (The CROWN Act), ensuring protection against race-based discrimination centered on a personâs hair texture and protective hairstyles. The act will be inserted into the Human Rights Section of the Connecticut General Statutes Section 46a-51. The language expands the definition of race to include âtraits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles; and âprotective hairstylesâ includes, but is not limited to, hairstyles such as braids, locs and twists.â The Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO) will have jurisdiction over complaints.

This act acknowledges the interconnectedness between hair and race, a recognition that courts have yet to embrace. In Rogers v. American Airlines (527 F. Supp. 229 (S.D.N.Y. 1981)), referred to as the âbraidsâ or the âcornrowsâ case, the court upheld what they determined was a race neutral grooming policy. This case was followed by a number of similar cases filed by Black men and women, all with similar results. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) v. Catastrophe Management Solutions, found that dreadlocks, though culturally associated with race, were not an immutable characteristic and therefore upheld the lower courtâs determination that there was no discrimination based on race.",,,0.998338044,1.0,negative,"Credit: melitas/Shutterstock.com On March 5, Gov.

Nearly 550 college athletes have stood up to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states with anti-trans sports legislation

to anti-transgender legislation by demanding the NCAA pull championships from states with anti-trans sports legislation The nationâs leading child health and welfare groups representing more than 7 million youth-serving professionals and more than 1000 child welfare organizations released an open letter calling for lawmakers in states across the country to oppose dozens of bills that target LGBTQ people, and transgender children in particular.

A fight driven by national anti-LGBTQ groups, not local legislators or public concern

These bills come from the same forces that drove previous anti-equality fights by pushing copycat bills across state houses â dangerous, anti-LGBTQ organizations like the Heritage Foundation, Alliance Defending Freedom (designated by Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group), and Eagle Forum among others.

For example, Montanaâs HB 112, the first anti-transgender sports bill to be passed through a legislative chamber in any state, was worked on by the Alliance Defending Freedom.

Trans equality is popular: Anti-transgender legislation is a low priority, even among Trump voters

In a 10-swing-state poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group last fall:

At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.

At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care, with many states breaking 90% support

When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues, the issue came in dead last, with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.

States that pass anti-transgender legislation suffer economic, legal, reputational harm

But some companies that are leading on the issue of racial justice are taking the next step: by adapting their hiring practices for those with criminal records, these firms are investing in true systemic change.

When companies step up to address the broken linkages from our criminal justice system to our workplaces, they initiate a winning cycle for our communities, for racial justice, and for our economy.

Second-chance hiring is not preferential treatment; it is simply equal treatment through the elimination of unnecessary systemic barriers. Many hiring managers are fearful of the very idea of a criminal record. But returning citizens are not a uniform category; they are individual applicants with individual profiles. Some made their mistakes decades ago. Many used their time in prison to develop valuable skills. Too many have been swept up by the extensive overreach and racial discrimination in our criminal justice system. All business decisions involve some degree of risk, but when firms systematically exclude those who have been involved in a racially biased and unjust system they only perpetuate the injustice. Companies can employ a simple HR principle: evaluate the individual rather than pre-judge the category.

At Georgetown University, we are committed to leveraging our expertise in education and business to create pathways for returning citizens. The Pivot Program serves D.C.s returning citizens and the local business community by providing education, internship opportunities, and entrepreneurial training to create the foundations for successful reentry. The program, a partnership among the Department of Employment Services, our McDonough School of Business, and Georgetowns Prisons and Justice Initiative, will graduate its third class in June.


Since the inception of the program, not a single graduate has returned to prison: our graduates are engaged in employment, in further education, and in entrepreneurial ventures. Pivot graduates confirm the accumulating research that second-chance hires are loyal and committed, resulting in higher productivity and lower turnover. Their successes have positive ripple effects for their families, the local economy, and our entire community.

But preparing our participants for successful reentry is only one step: The Pivot Program also is working to change the narrative around second-chance hiring and to engage the business community in our work. To date, dozens of local firms have provided internships and employment pathways for our graduates. At the same time, large global companies such as JP Morgan Chase, Starbucks, and Slack are now making second-chance hiring an intentional part of their recruitment strategies.

Intentional HR policies for returning citizens are the next frontier in corporate social responsibility, as well as in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, and will be a fundamental driver of racial justice in the future. Here in Washington, D.C., we have a diverse business ecosystem, and a thriving start-up community. Our city often is touted for its employment opportunities. So, our ask of you, D.C., is to take a serious look at the policies and practices you have in place regarding the employment of returning citizens. Do these policies serve the interests of the company and community? Do the hiring practices advance racial justice or perpetuate injustice?

We will be rebuilding from the pandemic soon  some businesses already are. As we recover, CEOs can build their teams in a new way, one that reaches into the communities of color that support their companies. There is no need for more statements, or to wait for police reform or legislation. If companies are serious about ending systemic racial injustice and inequality, about giving individuals and families the chance to lead productive lives, then they can act now to challenge assumptions, take a second look, and offer a second chance.

If your firm or organization would like to take the next step, let us know, and we can start a conversation.

Theyâre demonized and exploited, revered for their youth and reviled simply because theyâre young. They are todayâs teenagers, the post-millennials, who came of age during Trumpâs nightmare presidency, the flowering of the Black Lives Matter movement and #MeToo. In northern California, many of them were born and raised in the culture of cannabis. I recently spent a couple of weeks talking to dope smoking teens aged thirteen to nineteen, and while I found myself concerned about their life styles I also came away confident that they would figure out how to deal with whatever heads in their direction. What follows are portraits of some of todayâs teens, plus profiles of adults who interact with kids, especially when it comes to cannabis.

Martin Bolz began to smoke marijuana at 16. Now, three years later, heâs still smoking, though he says he wonât smoke forever. His âmarijuana habit,â as he calls it, wonât help him get into the U.S. Air Force. No, he doesnât want to drop bombs. He wants the Air Force to pay for grad school. âIâm a productive stoner,â Bolz tells me. âIâve been able to train my mind to do the same things with cannabis that I do without it.â

When asked to describe his relationship to weed, Bolz says, âItâs complicated.â Many if not most Norcal teens deplore weed and praise it, insist theyâd like to stop but go on using it. Are they addicted? Depends on how one defines addiction.

A computer science major at Sonoma State University (SSU), Bolz boasts a 3.9 GPA. Recently, the SSU police caught him smoking weed and told him to get off campus. On another occasion, he smoked in front of a cop. âI wanted to see how he might react,â Bolz told me. âHe did nothing.â

When his parents caught him using weedâhe filled the bathroom with smokeâ he had to move out. âI started as a secret smoker,â he tells me. âBut everyone knew I was a head. I grew my hair out and my skin color gave me away.â He extends his long brown arms. Bolzâs mother is a Latina, his father part Peruvian.

âAlcoholism runs in my family and Iâm afraid of being addicted to booze,â he says. Bolz isnât afraid of an addiction to marijuana, nor are most of his peers, the post-millennials, who belong to the latest in a long line of demographic groups in the U.S. targeted by the drug warriors.

North Bay teens do more than use marijuana, though over the last year their lifestyle choices have been more restricted than ever before. âThe kids are not alrightâ is a popular media theme. Indeed, todayâs kids are often at risk. Ever since the birth of âyouth cultureâ after World War II kids have been rebels with and without causes. Drugs play a part in their rebellion.

Opioids, heroin, cocaine, acid and speed are readily available on Main Street and wherever teens congregate. Marijuana is sold in dispensaries. The pandemic has persuaded Americans, including teens, to do more uppers and downers, pills, salves, tinctures and ediblesâand play more addicting video gamesâ than they had ever done before.

âItâs impossible to separate people from drugs,â sixteen-year-old Cadence Sinclair Eastman (not her real name) tells me. âYou canât stop people from having sex, either. The drug war was lost long ago.â

Half-a-century after President Nixon launched the âWar on Drugs,â which was a war on people, the drug warriors have lost three generations of Americans to marijuana. The warriors also bolstered the prison industrial complex, arresting and incarcerating tens of millions of Black and Latino boys and men and thereby helping to perpetuate Jim Crow.

If scare tactics donât persuade todayâs post-millennials (aged 1 to 21) to stay away from weed, the drug warriors might as well give up the ghost and do something useful, like provide accurate information about drugs, not try to terrify. Itâs now or never.

Sebastopolâs Jeffrey Hergenrather, a founding member of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, has been recommending marijuana ever since he became a doctor and lived on âThe Farm,â an intentional community in Tennessee back in the 1970s. Before then, he smoked occasionally when he was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. Hergenrather has worked with thousands of patients, old and young, parents and children, who have all kinds of ailments and infirmities.

âCannabis helps young people get through their teen years, which can be stressful,â he tells me. âIt helps them focus, alleviates depression and anxiety and eases insomnia.â Hergenrather adds, âItâs unreasonable to expect that teens wonât use cannabis. Itâs their drug of choice, and, while new users sometimes get spacy and abuse weed, they usually come to terms with it.â Hergenrather suggests that teens ought to use marijuana in safe environments, that they respect the wishes of their parents and that their parents let them use it at home.

Cadence Sinclair Eastman gets her weed from her father, a longtime cannabis farmer and dealer. Part Asian and part white, sheâs 16 going on 26. âParents who are okay with their kids smoking are rare,â Eastman tells me. âWhen parents forbid it, kids do it more often.â She adds, âI think itâs cool if parents allow, but not cool if they encourage.â Her father insists that she only smoke his weed, which she gets for free and which he also sells to some of her friends, if theyâre over the age of 16.

Eastman belongs to the northern California teenage cannabis subculture, but sheâs often critical of teens who smoke weed and sheâs also uncomfortable with her own use. âSometimes weed makes me anxious and sad,â she tells me. âWhen Iâm high I forget things and donât pay attention. Also, sometimes when I smoke with friends I think theyâre excluding me. We talk about it. Turns out, they have the same thoughts I have.â Maybe thatâs anxiety or paranoia.

Eastman doesnât use edibles. They put her to sleep. She would rather smoke with friends, than smoke alone, but that has been difficult if not impossible during the pandemic. âSmoking is bad for you,â she tells me. âIt kills brain cells and interferes with learning, though I have some friends who say it opens their creativity.â

The pandemic has curtailed much of Eastmanâs social life, which has revolved around skateboarding at skateboard parks, where drugs, including cannabis, acid and cocaine are part of the teen scene. Some smoke and skate, others only skate, while still others only smoke. I have observed the kids on several occasions, from Napa to Sebastopol and Novato. Adults are rarely around. Thereâs sex in the bushes and a teenage male macho culture. Females read books and talk about fictional characters.

Sixteen-year old Debbie, a high school sophomore, smoked for the first time at 13. âIt was in a car with a friend,â she says. âI felt natural, organic and fun, not scary. I went home, watched a movie and went to sleep.â Debbie grew up in a family of marijuana smokers and marijuana growers. Her parents told her, âdonât talk about it at school.â Debbieâs neighbors grew and smoked. She was surrounded by cannabis.

These days she mostly smokes on weekends, at home. âThereâs a lot of misinformation about cannabis,â she tells me. âSome people think itâs as bad as heroin. I think weed should be legalized.â When she looks around her, she sees the growth of the cannabis subculture: more growing, more selling and more using. âScaring people wonât work,â she says. âThe kids who smoke the most are the ones whose parents tell them not to smoke.â

The Sonoma County Department of Health Services offers a social media campaign to educate teens about the dangers of marijuana. The website, www.cannabisdecoded.org, features a photo of a sixteen-year-old girl who is quoted as saying âWhen I was getting high I thought I was having a good time. Actually I was missing out on a lot.â

As a teenager in the 1950s, I believed in the anti-pot propaganda I saw and read, the way some friends believed in God. I didnât smoke until I was 25, when Gus Reichbach, a law student who went on to become a New York State Supreme Court Judge, got me stoned. I giggled, ate ice cream and experienced spatial alteration, though two hours later I was back to normal. More than fifty-years later, I still get high. When I told my older brotherâa psychiatrist who prescribed pharmaceuticals for his patientsâthat I wrote six books under the influence of weed, he said, âYou would have written 12 books if you hadnât smoked at all.â

Like Sonoma County, Marin County, just north of San Francisco, has a program to educate teens about weed. A website shows a stunning indoor marijuana operation that looks more like an ad for weed, not propaganda against it. The Marin Prevention Network explains that the county has âa long history of widespread marijuana use and cultivation,â and that marijuana use among teens has âbecome commonplaceâ with âwidespread acceptance.â

A while ago, I attended Dr. Jennifer Golickâs hair-raising lectures to students, parents and educators in Marin. âThe weed that hippies smoked wasnât dangerous,â she told an audience at Redwood High School. âNow it is. Marijuana causes mental illness.â In fact, the weed hippies smoked was more dangerous than the weed that is used today. In hippie times, it was often grown in Mexico with toxic chemicals, and it had mold and mites.

Sadly, Dr. Golick was taken hostage and murdered by a former patient, an ex-U.S. Army Infantryman, who subsequently shot and killed himself. Marijuana might have helped with his PTSD.

The Sonoma County Department of Health Services works with Panaptic, an organization with a website that says, âmarijuana prevention is more urgent now than ever before.â On its website Panaptic says: âImagine growing up in a state where there are twice as many retail marijuana stores and dispensaries as Starbucks and McDonalds.â Panaptic might drop the military language evident in phrases that boast of âworking on the front lines of drug addiction.â

Panapticâs co-founder, Sarah Ferraro Cunningham, 43, lives in Petaluma and has a Psy.D. in psychology. Sheâs old enough to remember the ad that went viral that showed a man who fries an egg in a hot skillet and says, âThis is your brain on drugs.â Thatâs not Cunninghamâs style. A member of the new generation of psychologists she doesnât demonize. âIf you tell students âJust say Noâ they will clam up and you wonât connect to them,â she tells me.

Cunningham also told me that she smoked marijuana in college, that her grades dropped when she did and that when she âcut down dramaticallyâ her grades went up. Panapticâthe name means âview from aboveââ offers consultations, online courses and workshops, all of them focused on marijuana with teens, parents, families, teachers and schools, though it has not worked with any Sonoma County schools recently.

âWe emphasize neuroscience,â Cunningham explains. âWe canât honestly say that marijuana causes anxiety, but we can say that itâs more likely to cause it with those who do use marijuana.â What would success in your line of work look like, I asked her. âSuccess would mean getting teen wheels turning,â she says. She adds, âIâm reluctant to say success would also mean teens not using marijuana.â Indeed, that would doom Panaptic to failure.

Ask 13-year old Jack Black, Jr. (not his real name) who smokes once a week. His father rolls his joints. Last year, Jack Black, Jr. grew his first commercial crop, though he has been helping his father cultivate since he was 8. Three years ago, he witnessed armed police officers storm his house, arrest his father, handcuff him and take him away in a squad car. Thatâs a real drug education!

âGrowing weed is hard work,â Black, Jr. tells me. âItâs a long growing season. You have to give the plants lots of sun, water and compost tea and you have to watch out for powdery mildew.â What does he see in his own future? âI want to grow up and be a marijuana farmer and also have a real job, maybe at a fast-food place,â he tells me. He believes that his father has less rage when he smokes weed. âIâm more chill when I smoke,â he adds. âThough it can also make me tired and sleepy.â

A Sonoma County superintendent of schools who didnât want to be identified by name tells me, âItâs always difficult to be a teen because teens take risks and get into mischief. Itâs more difficult now because theyâre not on campus and theyâre sometimes hiding in their rooms.â

Last year two Sonoma County students died of fentanyl. âWith COVID-19, our big safety nets are gone,â the superintendent says. Last year there were a total of 94 deaths by fentanyl in Sonoma County. Yet another sign that the drug warriors have lost big time.

In his book Smoke Signals, author Martin Lee provides a comprehensive history of cannabis. In a recent email to me he wrote âironically marijuana is a controlled substance whose use proliferates everywhere in an uncontrolled manner.â He added, âIf the objective of cannabis prohibition was to enforce Jim Crow initially, which it did, and to impose a racially-based means of social control since the end of legal segregation, then anti cannabis laws have been a smashing success.â

The Sonoma County DAâs office still seems to regard the use of fentanyl as a crime, not a medical problem, which will only compound social and medical issues.

Colin, a 19-year-old, and a longtime cannabis user who grew up in a prosperous Sonoma County family, has been in therapy for eight years. âIâm introverted,â he tells me. âTherapy has helped with my insecurities.â When a peer pressured him to do drugs he exclaimed, âFuck off.â Colin looks back at his school years and remembers friends who became addicted to substances more dangerous than weed. âSome moved on to cocaine and ecstasy,â he says. âIâm glad I gave up dab pens. They were ruining my life.â Yes, indeed, the kids are alright, contrary to popular myths that say the opposite.

Everything You Wanted To Know About Pot Politics in Provincial Sonoma

If you think that Mendocino County has bombed its experiment with legal cannabis, youâre right. But itâs not the only place that has bombed. Indeed, take a look at the way the town of Sonoma buried its head in the sand for years. Van Solkov, the founder and Chief Financial Officer of Happy Travelers Tours, and a cannabis educator, tells me, âWeâve been a provincial place with a city council resistant to cannabis for a long time.â He adds, âSonoma has proven itself afraid of losing its identity as the heart of wine country.â

Thereâs something about cannabis that freaks people out, even when they donât smoke it. Maybe itâs the money. Or maybe itâs the fact that itâs still illegal by federal law. That said, itâs a minor miracle that on December 14, 2020, the Sonoma city council overcame its pathology about weed and voted 4-0-1 to grant a permit to the San Francisco Patient And Resource Center. Better known as âSPARC,â it operates a pot shop at 1256 Mission Street in San Francisco and has sister stores in Sebastopol and Santa Rosa. By the end of this year Sonoma will have a dispensaryâits one and onlyâon Highway 12.

The whole permitting process has been brutal, with emotional casualties all over the cannabis landscape. One activist who spoke off the record described it as âcannabilistic.â The only person who has emerged unscathed is Erich Pearson, SPARCâs founder and CEO, who has deep roots in the community, a sense of compassion and a love for cannabis, both recreationally and medicinally.

Once SPARC opens, Sonoma marijuana aficionados wonât have to drive forty minutesâas they do nowâto Mercy Wellness, a dispensary in Cotati to purchase tinctures, salves, joints and gummies. Of course, there is now as there has been for decades an illicit cannabis market which garners the lionâs share of sales in Sonoma.

âCannabis is the wild west,â former Sonoma city council member Rachel Hundley told me. âItâs interesting because itâs new.â She added, âCalifornia will always be the cannabis king.â When asked if she used it, she said, âYes, Iâm a consumer, though that might surprise my mother. It helps me sleep and with anxiety.â After Hundley announced her resignationâ which took effect January 31, 2021â she posted a searing statement on her Facebook page: âThe city council has continued down a path of reckless and, at times disturbing actions to settle personal scores, grant favors and elevate only themselves.â

Part of the problem has been that, unlike the wine industry, the cannabiz is finding its way in the dark and in the face of a stigma that hasnât vanished, despite scientific evidence that marijuana is effective medicine for a variety of ailments. Old bugaboos die hard. Weirdness has a habit of rearing its head.

Rachel Hundley told me that the events surrounding the dispensary would make for âa political thriller set in a small town, and with six different story lines that come together in the end.â Iâve written half-a-dozen of my own story lines, including the saga of David Cook, a council member who was arrested in November 2020 on charges of child molestation. He was never friendly to cannabis.

Hundley and councilmember Amy Harrington once cooperated on the dispensary issue. Then they clashed and drifted as far apart as one can drift on the political spectrum in Sonoma. At a city council meeting, Harrington accused Hundley of âunethicalâ behavior, though local reporter, Christian Kallen, found no evidence of âfinancial malfeasance.â

In a January 2021 letter of resignation from the council, Hundley wrote, âIf you have relied on The Sonoma Index Tribune as a primary source of information about what is happening within our City and community, then you are grossly under informed.â During a phone conversation with me, the I-Tâs publisher, Emily Charrier, said, âPeople love to shoot the messenger. Politicians and journalists are not meant to get along.â

Some citizens want an investigation by the Sonoma County Grand Jury. If that happens the grand juryâs star witness would be Amy Jenkins, who lives in Sonoma and works in Sacramento. A top-notch lobbyist for the California cannabis industry who was once associated with Darius Andersonâs Platinum Advisors, Jenkins told me that she has been called âthe pot girl.â Sheâs probably the most famous unknown political figure East of Sonoma Mountain. âCannabis is like an onion,â Jenkins said. âYou peel away one layer and then thereâs another and another and another.â Except for Pearson, no one is more delighted than she that SPARC won the competition.

Mike Benziger, who helped create Benziger Family Winery, now cultivates cannabis biodynamically not far from Jack London State Historic Park. Like Jenkins, heâs happy that the city awarded its first pot permit to Pearson whom he calls âa proven operator.â Benziger sells his weed to SPARC and Solful, a Sebastopol dispensary.

Pearson has promised to hire locals, pay them a living wage, promote local brands, and allocate 5 % of profits or a minimum of $20,000 annually for the benefit of the city. Pearson has also vowed to âdonate up to $4,000 a month of free product to qualified patients in the City and in the immediate surrounding area.â His foes accused him of aiming to operate a âmarijuana monopoly.â

Michael Coats, the president of the Sonoma Valley Cannabis Enthusiasts (SVCE), reminded me that âdozens of California municipalities, have one dispensary and no one squacks.â Some of those who cried âmonopolyâ the loudest were the losers in the dispensary âlottery,â including ex-mayor Ken Brown whose wife, Jewel Mathieson, died last year and whose ghost hovers over the cannabis scene.

Pearson told me that SPARC Sonoma will differ from the companyâs sister stores in Santa Rosa, Sebastopol and San Francisco. In part, thatâs because Sonoma is a tourist town and tourists have disposable income.

âThe challenge will be to make sure that visitors to the Valley consume cannabis safely, especially if and when they also drink wine,â Pearson said. âSome users will be newbies so weâll have to educate them and work with the city to provide places where they can consume lawfully.â He wants SPARC Sonoma to make friends with wineries, build bridges with wine lovers, and connect with Latinos who harvest grapes and cultivate cannabis on many of the pot farms.

Maybe the Sonoma political thriller will have a Hollywood ending. But it could also have a noir finale. Indeed, the dispensary issue revealed the darkness at the heart of sunny Sonoma, where reefer madness has too often reigned supreme.

They todays teenagers, post-millennials, came age Trumps nightmare presidency, flowering Black Lives Matter movement #MeToo. In northern California, many born raised culture cannabis. I recently spent couple weeks talking dope smoking teens aged thirteen nineteen, I found concerned life styles I also came away confident would figure deal whatever heads direction. What follows portraits todays teens, plus profiles adults interact kids, especially comes cannabis. Martin Bolz began smoke marijuana 16. Now, three years later, hes still smoking, though says wont smoke forever. His marijuana habit, calls it, wont help get U.S. Air Force. No, doesnt want drop bombs. He wants Air Force pay grad school. Im productive stoner, Bolz tells me. Ive able train mind things cannabis I without it. When asked describe relationship weed, Bolz says, Its complicated. Many Norcal teens deplore weed praise it, insist theyd like stop go using it. Are addicted? Depends one defines addiction. A computer science major Sonoma State University (SSU), Bolz boasts 3.9 GPA. Recently, SSU police caught smoking weed told get campus. On another occasion, smoked front cop. I wanted see might react, Bolz told me. He nothing. When parents caught using weedhe filled bathroom smoke move out. I started secret smoker, tells me. But everyone knew I head. I grew hair skin color gave away. He extends long brown arms. Bolzs mother Latina, father part Peruvian. Alcoholism runs family Im afraid addicted booze, says. Bolz isnt afraid addiction marijuana, peers, post-millennials, belong latest long line demographic groups U.S. targeted drug warriors. North Bay teens use marijuana, though last year lifestyle choices restricted ever before. The kids alright popular media theme. Indeed, todays kids often risk. Ever since birth youth culture World War II kids rebels without causes. Drugs play part rebellion. Opioids, heroin, cocaine, acid speed readily available Main Street wherever teens congregate. Marijuana sold dispensaries. The pandemic persuaded Americans, including teens, uppers downers, pills, salves, tinctures ediblesand play addicting video games ever done before. Its impossible separate people drugs, sixteen-year-old Cadence Sinclair Eastman (not real name) tells me. You cant stop people sex, either. The drug war lost long ago. Half-a-century President Nixon launched War Drugs, war people, drug warriors lost three generations Americans marijuana. The warriors also bolstered prison industrial complex, arresting incarcerating tens millions Black Latino boys men thereby helping perpetuate Jim Crow. If scare tactics dont persuade todays post-millennials (aged 1 21) stay away weed, drug warriors might well give ghost something useful, like provide accurate information drugs, try terrify. Its never. Sebastopols Jeffrey Hergenrather, founding member Society Cannabis Clinicians, recommending marijuana ever since became doctor lived The Farm, intentional community Tennessee back 1970s. Before then, smoked occasionally undergraduate UC Berkeley. Hergenrather worked thousands patients, old young, parents children, kinds ailments infirmities. Cannabis helps young people get teen years, stressful, tells me. It helps focus, alleviates depression anxiety eases insomnia. Hergenrather adds, Its unreasonable expect teens wont use cannabis. Its drug choice, and, new users sometimes get spacy abuse weed, usually come terms it. Hergenrather suggests teens ought use marijuana safe environments, respect wishes parents parents let use home. Cadence Sinclair Eastman gets weed father, longtime cannabis farmer dealer. Part Asian part white, shes 16 going 26. Parents okay kids smoking rare, Eastman tells me. When parents forbid it, kids often. She adds, I think its cool parents allow, cool encourage. Her father insists smoke weed, gets free also sells friends, theyre age 16. Eastman belongs northern California teenage cannabis subculture, shes often critical teens smoke weed shes also uncomfortable use. Sometimes weed makes anxious sad, tells me. When Im high I forget things dont pay attention. Also, sometimes I smoke friends I think theyre excluding me. We talk it. Turns out, thoughts I have. Maybe thats anxiety paranoia. Eastman doesnt use edibles. They put sleep. She would rather smoke friends, smoke alone, difficult impossible pandemic. Smoking bad you, tells me. It kills brain cells interferes learning, though I friends say opens creativity. The pandemic curtailed much Eastmans social life, revolved around skateboarding skateboard parks, drugs, including cannabis, acid cocaine part teen scene. Some smoke skate, others skate, still others smoke. I observed kids several occasions, Napa Sebastopol Novato. Adults rarely around. Theres sex bushes teenage male macho culture. Females read books talk fictional characters. Sixteen-year old Debbie, high school sophomore, smoked first time 13. It car friend, says. I felt natural, organic fun, scary. I went home, watched movie went sleep. Debbie grew family marijuana smokers marijuana growers. Her parents told her, dont talk school. Debbies neighbors grew smoked. She surrounded cannabis. These days mostly smokes weekends, home. Theres lot misinformation cannabis, tells me. Some people think its bad heroin. I think weed legalized. When looks around her, sees growth cannabis subculture: growing, selling using. Scaring people wont work, says. The kids smoke ones whose parents tell smoke. The Sonoma County Department Health Services offers social media campaign educate teens dangers marijuana. The website, www.cannabisdecoded.org, features photo sixteen-year-old girl quoted saying When I getting high I thought I good time. Actually I missing lot. As teenager 1950s, I believed anti-pot propaganda I saw read, way friends believed God. I didnt smoke I 25, Gus Reichbach, law student went become New York State Supreme Court Judge, got stoned. I giggled, ate ice cream experienced spatial alteration, though two hours later I back normal. More fifty-years later, I still get high. When I told older brothera psychiatrist prescribed pharmaceuticals patientsthat I wrote six books influence weed, said, You would written 12 books hadnt smoked all. Like Sonoma County, Marin County, north San Francisco, program educate teens weed. A website shows stunning indoor marijuana operation looks like ad weed, propaganda it. The Marin Prevention Network explains county a long history widespread marijuana use cultivation, marijuana use among teens become commonplace widespread acceptance. A ago, I attended Dr. Jennifer Golicks hair-raising lectures students, parents educators Marin. The weed hippies smoked wasnt dangerous, told audience Redwood High School. Now is. Marijuana causes mental illness. In fact, weed hippies smoked dangerous weed used today. In hippie times, often grown Mexico toxic chemicals, mold mites. Sadly, Dr. Golick taken hostage murdered former patient, ex-U.S. Army Infantryman, subsequently shot killed himself. Marijuana might helped PTSD. The Sonoma County Department Health Services works Panaptic, organization website says, marijuana prevention urgent ever before. On website Panaptic says: Imagine growing state twice many retail marijuana stores dispensaries Starbucks McDonalds. Panaptic might drop military language evident phrases boast working front lines drug addiction. Panaptics co-founder, Sarah Ferraro Cunningham, 43, lives Petaluma Psy.D. psychology.

Panapticthe name means view above offers consultations, online courses workshops, focused marijuana teens, parents, families, teachers schools, though worked Sonoma County schools recently. We emphasize neuroscience, Cunningham explains. We cant honestly say marijuana causes anxiety, say its likely cause use marijuana. What would success line work look like, I asked her. Success would mean getting teen wheels turning, says. She adds, Im reluctant say success would also mean teens using marijuana. Indeed, would doom Panaptic failure. Ask 13-year old Jack Black, Jr. (not real name) smokes week. His father rolls joints. Last year, Jack Black, Jr. grew first commercial crop, though helping father cultivate since 8. Three years ago, witnessed armed police officers storm house, arrest father, handcuff take away squad car. Thats real drug education! Growing weed hard work, Black, Jr. tells me. Its long growing season. You give plants lots sun, water compost tea watch powdery mildew. What see future? I want grow marijuana farmer also real job, maybe fast-food place, tells me. He believes father less rage smokes weed. Im chill I smoke, adds. Though also make tired sleepy. A Sonoma County superintendent schools didnt want identified name tells me, Its always difficult teen teens take risks get mischief. Its difficult theyre campus theyre sometimes hiding rooms. Last year two Sonoma County students died fentanyl. With COVID-19, big safety nets gone, superintendent says. Last year total 94 deaths fentanyl Sonoma County. Yet another sign drug warriors lost big time. In book Smoke Signals, author Martin Lee provides comprehensive history cannabis. In recent email wrote ironically marijuana controlled substance whose use proliferates everywhere uncontrolled manner. He added, If objective cannabis prohibition enforce Jim Crow initially, did, impose racially-based means social control since end legal segregation, anti cannabis laws smashing success. The Sonoma County DAs office still seems regard use fentanyl crime, medical problem, compound social medical issues. Colin, 19-year-old, longtime cannabis user grew prosperous Sonoma County family, therapy eight years. Im introverted, tells me. Therapy helped insecurities. When peer pressured drugs exclaimed, Fuck off. Colin looks back school years remembers friends became addicted substances dangerous weed. Some moved cocaine ecstasy, says. Im glad I gave dab pens. They ruining life. Yes, indeed, kids alright, contrary popular myths say opposite. Everything You Wanted To Know About Pot Politics Provincial Sonoma If think Mendocino County bombed experiment legal cannabis, youre right. But its place bombed. Indeed, take look way town Sonoma buried head sand years. Van Solkov, founder Chief Financial Officer Happy Travelers Tours, cannabis educator, tells me, Weve provincial place city council resistant cannabis long time. He adds, Sonoma proven afraid losing identity heart wine country. Theres something cannabis freaks people out, even dont smoke it. Maybe its money. Or maybe its fact its still illegal federal law. That said, its minor miracle December 14, 2020, Sonoma city council overcame pathology weed voted 4-0-1 grant permit San Francisco Patient And Resource Center. Better known SPARC, operates pot shop 1256 Mission Street San Francisco sister stores Sebastopol Santa Rosa. By end year Sonoma dispensaryits one onlyon Highway 12. The whole permitting process brutal, emotional casualties cannabis landscape. One activist spoke record described cannabilistic. The person emerged unscathed Erich Pearson, SPARCs founder CEO, deep roots community, sense compassion love cannabis, recreationally medicinally. Once SPARC opens, Sonoma marijuana aficionados wont drive forty minutesas nowto Mercy Wellness, dispensary Cotati purchase tinctures, salves, joints gummies. Of course, decades illicit cannabis market garners lions share sales Sonoma. Cannabis wild west, former Sonoma city council member Rachel Hundley told me. Its interesting its new. She added, California always cannabis king. When asked used it, said, Yes, Im consumer, though might surprise mother. It helps sleep anxiety. After Hundley announced resignation took effect January 31, 2021 posted searing statement Facebook page: The city council continued path reckless and, times disturbing actions settle personal scores, grant favors elevate themselves. Part problem that, unlike wine industry, cannabiz finding way dark face stigma hasnt vanished, despite scientific evidence marijuana effective medicine variety ailments. Old bugaboos die hard. Weirdness habit rearing head. Rachel Hundley told events surrounding dispensary would make a political thriller set small town, six different story lines come together end. Ive written half-a-dozen story lines, including saga David Cook, council member arrested November 2020 charges child molestation. He never friendly cannabis. Hundley councilmember Amy Harrington cooperated dispensary issue. Then clashed drifted far apart one drift political spectrum Sonoma. At city council meeting, Harrington accused Hundley unethical behavior, though local reporter, Christian Kallen, found evidence financial malfeasance. In January 2021 letter resignation council, Hundley wrote, If relied The Sonoma Index Tribune primary source information happening within City community, grossly informed. During phone conversation me, I-Ts publisher, Emily Charrier, said, People love shoot messenger. Politicians journalists meant get along. Some citizens want investigation Sonoma County Grand Jury. If happens grand jurys star witness would Amy Jenkins, lives Sonoma works Sacramento. A top-notch lobbyist California cannabis industry associated Darius Andersons Platinum Advisors, Jenkins told called the pot girl. Shes probably famous unknown political figure East Sonoma Mountain. Cannabis like onion, Jenkins said. You peel away one layer theres another another another. Except Pearson, one delighted SPARC competition. Mike Benziger, helped create Benziger Family Winery, cultivates cannabis biodynamically far Jack London State Historic Park. Like Jenkins, hes happy city awarded first pot permit Pearson calls a proven operator. Benziger sells weed SPARC Solful, Sebastopol dispensary. Pearson promised hire locals, pay living wage, promote local brands, allocate 5 % profits minimum $20,000 annually benefit city. Pearson also vowed donate $4,000 month free product qualified patients City immediate surrounding area. His foes accused aiming operate marijuana monopoly. Michael Coats, president Sonoma Valley Cannabis Enthusiasts (SVCE), reminded dozens California municipalities, one dispensary one squacks. Some cried monopoly loudest losers dispensary lottery, including ex-mayor Ken Brown whose wife, Jewel Mathieson, died last year whose ghost hovers cannabis scene. Pearson told SPARC Sonoma differ companys sister stores Santa Rosa, Sebastopol San Francisco. In part, thats Sonoma tourist town tourists disposable income. The challenge make sure visitors Valley consume cannabis safely, especially also drink wine, Pearson said. Some users newbies well educate work city provide places consume lawfully. He wants SPARC Sonoma make friends wineries, build bridges wine lovers, connect Latinos harvest grapes cultivate cannabis many pot farms. Maybe Sonoma political thriller Hollywood ending. But could also noir finale. Indeed, dispensary issue revealed darkness heart sunny Sonoma, reefer madness often reigned supreme.

DUBAI: In the past decade, the world has witnessed a pressing need for a major transformation from conventional energy sources to renewables starting with planned efforts in limiting the global temperature from rising to 2.0ÂºC (3.6ËF) for the present century.



A number of producer economies have recognized the need to diversify their energy production while simultaneously seeking to diversify their economies by putting energy transitions at the heart of their development strategies. Saudi Arabia, the worldâs largest oil exporter, has, in turn, experienced an emergence of a solar sector as part of its economic diversification plans under the Kingdomâs Vision 2030.



Saudi businessman Khaled Ahmad Sharbatly, the managing partner of Desert Technologies, which specializes in solar energy, offers insight into how the launch of the solar industry in the Kingdom prompted business development and outlines both the opportunities and barriers for the countryâs expansion into âyellow gold.â



In addition to his position in Desert Technologies, Sharbatly, 26, has undertaken courses at the UN, Harvard Business School, Harvard Law, and completed a fellowship from the International Monetary Fund that was only given to 20 people around the world. He holds two posts, one in the Chinese-Saudi Business Council and another in the industrial council of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce, where he is leading the team for the general overview of sustainable manufacturing that is focused on supporting industries that have been affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and how they can have a sustainable recovery.



Having spoken at over 15 international conferences, including the Business Twenty (B20) the official business community engagement forum for the Group of Twenty (G20), the World Future Energy Summit (WFES), Intersolar, and others within the span of two years, Sharbatly describes himself as an active sustainability and renewable energy influencer that promotes sustainable development initiatives within personal and professional environments.



While the Kingdomâs Vision 2030 provides for the transformation of Saudi Aramco into a multi-sectoral industrial powerhouse, private solar firms, such as Desert Technologies, have already sprung with growing expectations about the market, carving their position within the industry with projects in 26 countries worth more than $200 million.



Sharbatly said that his decision to dive into the renewable energy industry was prompted by the Vision 2030 goals of revolutionizing environmental sustainability, which ultimately leads to the capitalization of the growing demand for sustainable investments.



âIn 2016, when the initial draft of the Saudi Vision 2030 was released, I took a look at that draft and I saw where our country was heading in the next 15 years,â Sharbatly said.



âI saw that sustainability was a huge component of it. Getting out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy is an area of huge strength for the Kingdom because we are the energy suppliers of the world.



âSo if we change from fossil fuels to gas, from gas to hydrogen, from hydrogen to solar or from solar to wind, it would be indifferent as we can build the industry, given that we have the supply chain, the logistics and the full infrastructure for that. It is much more attainable than many other industries, and in terms of logistics, we have two of the largest ports in the red sea, almost 70 percent of the worldâs trade goes through us.â



Saudi Arabiaâs socio-economic development in recent decades has been driven by oil-and-gas revenues. The vast wealth it pumped out was a major contributor to the governmentâs budget revenues, paying not only for the glistening skyscrapers but also for a government sector that employs a high percentage of Saudis.



With its vast deserts, the Kingdom is now linking its future to another natural resource it has in even greater abundance: sunlight.



The Saudi government has set a target of generating 9.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, which will generate enough electricity to power around 40,000 homes.



âEven though we have an impressive natural potential for solar and wind power, and our local energy consumption will increase threefold by 2030, we still lack a competitive renewable energy sector at present. To build up the sector, we have set ourselves an initial target of generating 9.5 gigawatts of renewable energy,â a Saudi cabinet statement said on the Saudi Vision 2030.



Forming part of the GCC, Saudi Arabia lies within the so-called âglobal sunbeltâ and has some of the highest solar irradiances in the world with over 3,000 hours of sunlight annually. Around 60 percent of the regionâs surface area has been found to have a particularly high level of suitability for solar PV deployment, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).



âCurrently we work through the companyâs factory in Jeddah to collect and market solar panels produced in Saudi Arabia for use in multiple facilities such as schools, exhibitions, mosques, factories, warehouses and soon homes all over the Kingdom to reduce the kilowatt price for companies and individuals,â Sharbatly said.



Representing a firm that is taking advantage of its country's most abundant clean-energy source, Sharbatly said Desert Technologies builds the smart infrastructure of the future, powered by the sun.



âSmart infrastructure is a wide array of products and services to be developed, constructed, or manufactured and that is what we do â we manufacture, we develop and we construct,â Sharbatly said. âWe manufacture solar panels, we manufacture power plants, invest in power plants by selling electricity and we construct plants.



âToday, we will invest in smart infrastructures such as utility-scale projects or the regular solar panel projects that can be seen on roofs or grounds. Solar plus battery, solar plus diesel, hybrid systems, and also powering vehicles using renewable energy, because we think there is a huge field where we are trying to be sustainable and buy electric vehicles. But we are powering them using conventional electricity, or we buy energy-efficient refrigerators that save money, which defeats the objective,â Sharbatly said.



Smart infrastructure essentially leverages data and digital connectivity to improve certain functions, including sustainable energy management. That aims to help in achieving a lower carbon footprint through the production of more efficient infrastructure and planning.



âWe are trying to power all these products that have already taken a step towards sustainability with real sustainable sources of energy. It is solar today, but in the future, it could be something else as we are flexible and technology agnostic,â Sharbatly said.



âSustainability is Vision 2030 â how can we build a country that is not dependent on one major source of income but have sustainable development across all sectors such as social, governmental, environmental, commercial, for the future,â Sharbatly said.



âThe countryâs location and climate mean it has plenty of promising sites for solar and even wind farms.â



The abundance of solar resource potential primarily indicated by its strategic location, accompanied by the recent fall in global oil prices and the falling cost of associated technologies, such as photovoltaic (PV) modules are major factors influencing the appeal of solar energy in the country. The costs of installing and operating such technologies have fallen drastically around the world in recent years, which means that even in a country where oil is copious, renewables still beckon as a cheap and clean alternative to traditional fossil fuels.



âToday solar is around 90 percent cheaper than oil and gas,â Sharbatly said.



âThe first step onwards to this transition is hybrid solutions. Hybrid solutions are the first gateway to complete renewable energy or a 100-percent clean energy future. Today we have oil, we have power plants, we have diesel generators and we are not going to replace them as the energy demand is increasing, even if it is at a small rate. It is still increasing and we cannot convince people to throw away investments that they have made and bring something else when they have not made the return yet. This is the world view, not just my view. We have to transition into sustainability and into a sustainable grid powered by sustainable energy sources.â



The initial driver behind the Saudi governmentâs interest in the use of solar power was its intention to diversify its energy mix towards alternative sources, including renewables in order to preserve domestic energy production for export amid rising domestic consumption of oil for power generation.



âOil, coal, gas, or any other source of energy will never, at least for the next 100 years, be out of the energy mix,â Sharbatly said. âWe will use these fossil fuels to create all sorts of products. That's the true value of fossil fuels â to create value and products, instead of burning them to create electricity. We can make electricity in cheaper, cleaner ways.â



The global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, which is a 1.9 billion increase from 2020, according to the UN. Concurrently, as urbanization continues, the proportion of the population living in urban areas will increase to around 66 percent by 2050, up from 30 percent in 1950.



Saudi Arabiaâs capital Riyadh will at least double in size from its current population of around 7.5 million people by 2030. The countryâs population will reach 45 million by 2050, implying a population increase of about 13.5 million from 2015. Meanwhile, the proportion of the urban population will increase at a dramatically higher rate than other countries, to under 90 percent by 2050, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.



This high rate of population growth and urbanization has driven a rise in domestic energy and electricity demand. Peak electricity load in Saudi Arabia, for instance, has been rising by 7 percent every year. Electricity consumption has grown from 186.5 Terawatt hour (TWh) in 2008 to 345.05TWh in 2018, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) data. Further increase in such trends inevitably poses significant questions for sustainability and is anticipated to place unparalleled pressures on energy demand and supply.



In line with these trends, Desert Technologies has started working on the expansion of its factory from 100 MW to 200 MW yearly production, which is indicative of the heightened demand for renewables in the region. In 2021, the company plans to increase its presence within the Middle East and signed four projects by February. Two of the projects are in Saudi Arabia, one is in Bahrain and the one in Egypt is set to be completed by 2022.



The firmâs goals for the next five years echo such expansions, with intentions of accumulating projects in the Middle East and Africa. In Asia, Desert Technologies will be doing up to $3.5 billion of work, with a specific focus on the small to medium scale on-grid and off-grid solutions, according to Sharbatly. It also plans on releasing two other companies, one of which is a development company that will be released as a joint venture.



Furthermore, the firm seeks to grow in Southeast Asia and Latin America to further build its track record. Sharbatly mentioned Japan as a particular country of interest.



âThey are very advanced in technology and there is an incredible relationship between Saudi Arabia and Japan,â Sharbatly said. âThere is a big presence of Japanese companies, bands and investors in Saudi and vice versa. We are amazed by how advanced they are. Also, we like their work ethic, we like their honesty and culture, all of which we think fits with ours.â



Sharbatly then discussed why renewable energy is not being utilized fully in Saudi Arabia, despite the availability of necessary resources and the challenges associated with such an energy transition.



âTo localize an industry is not an easy job and Saudi is trying to start where everyone else has finished,â he said.



âIt requires a huge investment in infrastructure, training, building facilities because it is pointless to invest in building power plants or to allow companies to come and bid for building power plants when the jobs they are going to be making as a developer or contractor are short-term jobs. The strategic value in localizing an industry is creating manufacturing industries where there are long-term jobs that require highly skilled people and require universities and highly skilled programs to really support the training of these people. Just like we have excelled in oil and gas, we can excel in this.â



Sharbatly said COVID-19 has delayed the process.



âIt needs time â time to build state-of-the-art facilities, to sign with suppliers from around the world and localize the industry,â he said. âThe government right now is really focused on health and saving the lives of its people, but hopefully in the upcoming year and in 2022 there will be a lot of very good news on new manufacturing facilities, including ours.â



Another reason such a transition requires time is those energy transition pathways that imply an imminent peak and then a steep drop in oil demand would result in sharply reduced revenues for many countries.



This yearâs coronavirus-induced decrease in oil demand and the subsequent impact on prices put this challenge in stark relief. It demonstrates not only the effect a rapid transition would have on the world economy, but also provides an admonitory observation of the future if success is not achieved in the diversification efforts of key producer economies.



Pointing out that once electricity is generated, it cannot be stored, except in limited amounts using batteries, but can be sent long distances across the grid, Sharbatly said: âStorage today is quite competitive, especially from unsubsidized energy. In countries like Saudi or the GCC, storage is very difficult because it is more expensive than the energy you get from the government, while in Africa it is much cheaper.â



The storage of excess energy produced still presents a problem due to limited storage capacities and overproduction that can result in losses. Consequently, one of the main objectives of building sustainable smart infrastructure is to enable the adaptation of energy production to actual demand. This entails the achievement of demand-oriented production that can, with proper infrastructure and planning, allow immediate consumption of produced energy.



The development of different sectors of smart infrastructures, such as smart energy and smart transportation would enable the accumulation of real-world data that can be interconnected for use among different services.



Desert Technologies also plays a role in assisting Saudi Arabia in becoming a renewable-energy exporter and supplier through their major operations in developing and emerging markets that use solar PV panels manufacturing in the country.



For example, Desert Technologies was a co-developer for several solar photovoltaic projects in Benban, Egypt, which is one of the worldâs largest solar farms. This includes the ARC Project, which has the capacity to generate 65.7 megawatt (MW) of energy, the Winnergy Project, with a 24.9MW generation capacity and the Arinna Project, with a 24.9MW generation capacity. The electricity generated from these plants is sold to the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) under a 25-year power purchase agreement. Cumulatively, Benbanâs fields consist of 6 million panels that produce 1.5 gigawatts (gw) of energy, which is enough to power more than one million homes.



While many countries are now exploring ways to stimulate social and economic growth through the development of the renewable energy sector within their own parameters, Desert Technologies has chosen to target less economically developed countries to promote sustainable economic development.



In 2019, there were 771 million people without electricity access, which was a record low. This was enabled through the use of grid electrification as the primary source of energy access gained since 2000, according to data from World Energy Outlook 2018. Despite such progress, the world remains far from achieving SDG targets to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. The population without access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains at 579 million, amounting to 56 percent of the population.



The manufacturing division at Desert Technologies called âDT Labsâ invests in research and development to create new and better solutions. The current areas of infrastructure innovation include the development of solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations and solar street lamps that can provide Wi-Fi and phone charging services. The company is also developing mini-grid systems that reuse lithium-ion batteries, from cars or computers, to build economic and efï¬cient mini-grid and off-grid solar systems in Africa.



The challenges associated with electricity provision in developing countries extend beyond the sphere of private investment and involve difficulties associated with infrastructure. The innovative approaches to solving the problem by Desert Technologies demonstrate how international investments in renewable energy can provide key resources and help in the creation of enabling environments through the provision of sustainable, efficient, and equitable electricity in regions critical to the global climate future.



The oil and gas producers in the Middle East and North Africa region are conscious of the potential adverse impacts of climate change and the impact it will have on their economies, given their current dependence on oil and gas revenues. This makes the way in which the increasing energy demand across the region is met highly significant, and the argument for renewables, particularly solar PV, in obtaining a larger role in the energy mix, even more compelling.



Desert Technologies, with its ambitious projects that are already yielding results throughout the region, serves as one example of how the Kingdom can leverage its abundant resources, domestic expertise and competitive advantage in energy production.

With vast deserts, Kingdom linking future another natural resource even greater abundance: sunlight. The Saudi government set target generating 9.5 gigawatts (GW) renewable energy 2030, generate enough electricity power around 40,000 homes. Even though impressive natural potential solar wind power, local energy consumption increase threefold 2030, still lack competitive renewable energy sector present. To build sector, set initial target generating 9.5 gigawatts renewable energy, Saudi cabinet statement said Saudi Vision 2030. Forming part GCC, Saudi Arabia lies within so-called global sunbelt highest solar irradiances world 3,000 hours sunlight annually.

Currently work companys factory Jeddah collect market solar panels produced Saudi Arabia use multiple facilities schools, exhibitions, mosques, factories, warehouses soon homes Kingdom reduce kilowatt price companies individuals, Sharbatly said. Representing firm taking advantage country's abundant clean-energy source, Sharbatly said Desert Technologies builds smart infrastructure future, powered sun. Smart infrastructure wide array products services developed, constructed, manufactured manufacture, develop construct, Sharbatly said. We manufacture solar panels, manufacture power plants, invest power plants selling electricity construct plants. Today, invest smart infrastructures utility-scale projects regular solar panel projects seen roofs grounds. Solar plus battery, solar plus diesel, hybrid systems, also powering vehicles using renewable energy, think huge field trying sustainable buy electric vehicles. But powering using conventional electricity, buy energy-efficient refrigerators save money, defeats objective, Sharbatly said. Smart infrastructure essentially leverages data digital connectivity improve certain functions, including sustainable energy management. That aims help achieving lower carbon footprint production efficient infrastructure planning. We trying power products already taken step towards sustainability real sustainable sources energy.

It also plans releasing two companies, one development company released joint venture. Furthermore, firm seeks grow Southeast Asia Latin America build track record. Sharbatly mentioned Japan particular country interest. They advanced technology incredible relationship Saudi Arabia Japan, Sharbatly said. There big presence Japanese companies, bands investors Saudi vice versa. We amazed advanced are. Also, like work ethic, like honesty culture, think fits ours. Sharbatly discussed renewable energy utilized fully Saudi Arabia, despite availability necessary resources challenges associated energy transition. To localize industry easy job Saudi trying start everyone else finished, said. It requires huge investment infrastructure, training, building facilities pointless invest building power plants allow companies come bid building power plants jobs going making developer contractor short-term jobs. The strategic value localizing industry creating manufacturing industries long-term jobs require highly skilled people require universities highly skilled programs really support training people. Just like excelled oil gas, excel this. Sharbatly said COVID-19 delayed process. It needs time time build state-of-the-art facilities, sign suppliers around world localize industry, said.

A podcast started by a local school board is giving a chance for non-Indigenous people to learn and space for Indigenous students to feel represented. The Word Up podcast is hosted by Erin Buchmann, the Indigenous instructional coach at District School Board Ontario North East (DSB1). Every episode, she is joined by a co-host and a special guest to talk about their work as an Indigenous artist, athlete, musician, author or community leader. The idea for the podcast came as the board was looking at ways to encourage professional learning during the pandemic, Buchmann said. The podcast, originally focused on literature, is a way to align with the recently-introduced Grade 11 English course, Understanding Contemporary First Nations, MÃ©tis and Inuit Voices, and to allow teachers to learn more about Indigenous authors. Since its launch in December, the podcast has evolved. The focus has shifted to allow students to lead the conversations and feel reflected. The podcast also allowed schools across the board to collaborate amid the pandemic and enabled teachers to engage without having to leave their classrooms. âThat was the need that we had and that was the starting point,â Buchmann said. âI think itâs really important when every year, youâre looking to elevate voice in this way that you take time to listen, to take time to ask questions from the people around you so that you have their support.â Buchmann said she wants to challenge the notion that stories can only be text-based. For her, a story comes in different formats whether it's music, art or land. Timmins High and Vocational School Grade 11 student Abbygail Anderson was one of the first students who co-hosted a podcast. Together with her English teacher Brady Power and Buchmann, she interviewed Jesse Thistle, the author of From the Ashes. When Power asked her to do the podcast, she was very excited. âIt shows that no matter what age group youâre in, you can still do stuff like this,â she said. âItâs OK to express yourself in different ways. A lot of kids are struggling with opening up to people but this gives kids the chance to express themselves in different ways.â Anderson said it was interesting to read the book and talk to the author about it. Co-hosting the podcast with her teacher also brought them closer together, she said. âMy experience reading the book, you just feel very connected. You understand how heâs feeling. Even talking to him was amazing, he elaborated on so many things, which was really awesome,â she said. Buchmann said the podcast is also a part of the reconciliation process. âThe podcast is an example of the commitment to relationships. Itâs a commitment to allowing Indigenous voice to have space within education,â she said. âItâs a commitment to representation to our students, making sure students see themselves reflected in the curriculum, in leadership.â The podcast currently has five episodes. Buchmann said four more interviews have been lined up in the next two weeks. Ideally, the goal is to have an episode released every two weeks until the end of May, then reconsider how to do the podcast next year. Each episode, from start to finish, takes about five to six hours. Sometimes, Buchmann sends an email to a principal asking if thereâs anyone interested in co-hosting. In the last few weeks, teachers have started to contact her with pitches. There is a wish list of some big celebrities that people want to see as guests, according to Buchmann. âAs much as kids want to dream, we can go for it,â she said. âI thought why not, we can try.â The podcast started for high school students only, but elementary teachers have started reaching out, Buchmann said. She connects with a teacher first and itâs up to a teacher to choose a student for co-hosting. They do individual research and come up with questions through a shared Google document before getting together and trying to pare down similar questions. That in itself becomes a whole exercise, teaching students how to ask open-ended questions to encourage people to talk, Buchmann said. On the day of the interview, Buchmann meets with her team about 30 minutes beforehand. After the interview, they do a debrief to talk about how it went. It takes Buchmann from 30 minutes to up to two hours to edit the podcast. Doing podcasts over Zoom allows participants not to worry about travel, Buchmann said, but there have been some limitations to it Technology is one of the challenges. There were a few times when it can freeze in the middle of an interview. Before going with Zoom, the hosts also tested different apps but they didnât allow participants to see each other. âWe felt that was really important, for students especially. You donât want to just hear, you want to be able to see (the guests),â Buchmann said. Anderson agreed, saying she likes seeing peopleâs expressions and prefers doing interviews over Zoom rather than over the phone. Time can be another issue. âJust making sure we all have the time. We know, especially right now, people are tired, so I donât want to overwhelm anybody,â Buchmann said. âAnd because we have a shorter semester right now, itâs harder for some teachers to find the time and for students to be out of class for an hour.â To date, the podcast has had 266 unique listeners and 384 episode downloads, according to Chad Mowbray, the boardâs principal of curriculum, innovation and technology. The top three episodes were A Reconcillition Journey featuring Indigenous Student Trustees and the Indigenous Student Lead, the Youâre Going to Make Mistakes, and Thatâs OK podcast with Jesse Thistle, and From the Shores of James Bay with the award-winning musician Stan Louttit. The top five countries listeners are from Canada, the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia, with Brazil, Israel and Japan all tying for fifth place. âThe podcast is such an innovative way for our students and teachers to engage and contribute to reconciliation and decolonization,â Mowbray said in a statement. âIt is empowering for them to see that their voice matters and that others around the world value what they have to share.â December and February have seen the highest number of listeners, Mowbray said, but it looks like March might see more as it is already the third-highest month. The podcast averages 24 downloads a week. It is available on iTunes, Amazon Music, Spotify and Google Podcasts. The majority of listeners listen via iTunes followed by Spotify. Buchmann said it was âslow to startâ but the feedback has been positive from the participants and their families and now people contact her to get involved. She said sheâs been surprised by how willing the guests have been to participate in the podcast. Buchmann said that other school boards are probably hosting similar podcasts but The Word Up podcast is a âreal conscious effortâ to make sure all levels across the board are engaging. In order to host an Indigenous-focused podcast, itâs important to consult with the communities, she said. âYou might have a community who really wants you to focus on traditional teachings and that becomes your podcast. Youâre interviewing elders instead of authors,â she said. From an educational point of view, Buchmann advised consulting with students and teachers as well as the school board to make sure the podcast aligns with the boardâs vision and goals. Buchmannâs hope is to encourage Indigenous students and educators to feel empowered by this podcast. It is also to encourage non-Indigenous teachers and students to learn. As a non-Indigenous person herself who has worked in Indigenous education for 15 years, Buchmann said she takes away new lessons and insight every time she talks to guests and students. âThe more we listen to each other, the more we do learn,â she said. âWe need to become more aware of stories that arenât our own.â Dariya Baiguzhiyeva, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, TimminsToday.com",,,-0.969515681,1.0,,"Local Journalism Initiative A podcast started local school board giving chance non-Indigenous people learn space Indigenous students feel represented.

   instruction at the St. Pete campus, has dedicated her career to
   facilitating research and guiding others who have the same
   passions for library sciences and education. SPECIAL TO THE
   ORACLE

     [84] https://www.usforacle.com/author/news_editor/

   This story is part of a continuing series that features women
   leaders at USF during Womens History Month.

   Kaya van Beynen has made her mark around the globe  teaching
   across the sea in southeast Asia, completing her studies in
   ice-cold temperatures in Canada and Massachusetts, examining
   age-old exhibits in Washington, D.C. and most recently
   venturing down to Florida  all in the name of education.

   After graduating with a bachelors degree in anthropology from
   McGill University in Montreal, van Beynens career path was
   flexible. She was unsure of what she wanted to dedicate her
   life to, but since earning her masters degree in library and
   information science from Simmons University in 2003, she moved
   up in the field from being a visiting librarian to now USFs
   associate dean of library research and instruction.

   I thought, well, I like research, I want to be mobile and
   theres jobs in libraries everywhere. I did not want to be a
   professor or researcher, so I went back to library school and
   got my degree, super fast track in one year, said van Beynen.

   After her recent appointment as associate dean of library
   research and instruction in August, van Beynen was awarded the
   Distinguished Education and Behavioral Sciences Librarian Award
   only six months later in March, which comes with $2,500 in cash
   and a plaque sponsored by the American Psychological
   Association.

   The award is given by the Education and Behavioral Sciences
   Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries to
   a distinguished academic librarian that has made specific
   contributions in the fields of education or behavioral
   sciences. As the 2021 recipient, van Beynen will also be
   honored for her award at the annual American Library
   Association conference, which has shifted online due to the
   pandemic.

   When she received the news, it was after a long, busy day at
   work. The official email notification actually went to her spam
   folder days before.

   I checked, I had a message on my email as a voice recording,
   said van Beynen. I listened to it and it was a colleague of
   mine from up in [Albany State University] saying, Kaya, you
   won the award. We sent you the emails a couple of days ago and
   you havent responded, we thought you were responding and they
   really need your information and your picture and are you still
   wanting it? And Im like What? Whats going on?

   Of course, it made my day that much better instantly. It was
   wonderful.

   Before her career in librarianship, traveling was at the top of
   her bucket list after finishing her undergraduate degree. She
   went off on her own to Vietnam to teach English in 1996 after
   the country opened its borders to Americans for the first time
   since the Vietnam War.

   I thought that would be an exciting place to go to. I went,
   and it was exciting. It was wonderful. It was interesting. I
   was in Ho Chi Minh City, which was [previously known as]
   Saigon, said van Beynen. I stayed there [and] it was easy to
   find work teaching English. I made enough to survive, live
   cheaply. Thats all I needed at that point.

   The road from Vietnam to her current position at USF was a
   bumpy one, full of twists and turns that exposed her to all
   kinds of people and experiences.

   I always admire people who know what they want to do, and knew
   at the start what they wanted to do. They had a focus, a career
   and all of that, said van Beynen. That was never me.

   Upon returning from Ho Chi Minh City, she chose to explore a
   new avenue of work as an intern at the Smithsonian Institution.
   She worked for a year in Washington, D.C. conducting
   assessments of the various exhibits at all of its museums and
   was hired as an employee within one month of working as an
   unpaid intern.

   I came back from Vietnam and I was like, OK, what the hell am
   I going to do? And I was thinking to myself, Well, Im an
   American whos never lived in America, said van Beynen. So,
   I thought Well, Im trying to explore, maybe I want to work in
   museums or anthropology.

   Her time at the Smithsonian ultimately opened the door for her
   to start work as a visiting librarian at USFs St. Pete Nelson
   Poynter Memorial Library in 2006 when it needed a new librarian
   with assessment experience.

   St. Petes work environment was filled with supportive and
   uplifting mentors who offered van Beynen, as well as her
   colleagues, opportunities to grow in her librarianship and into
   exciting and innovative learners.

   We have a work environment where one persons successes are
   celebrated, and were all trying to support and help each
   other, said van Beynen.

   As she rose to her current position as associate dean, van
   Beynen stepped into her own as a mentor for those she works
   with. Catherine Cardwell, dean of the Nelson Poynter Memorial
   Library at the St. Pete campus, was able to witness van
   Beynens care for her colleagues as her supervisor for five
   years.

   Shes very committed to being a mentor. Its just a part of
   her fabric, said Cardwell. I think she recognizes the
   librarians and the faculty who were mentors to her when she was
   a young librarian coming through, and so she really emphasizes
   paying it back to early-career library faculty and staff and
   she really embraces that role.

   As a continuous learner and someone always wanting to go the
   extra mile, there was a point in van Beynens career where she
   had to sit down and do some introspection when her work at St.
   Pete felt static.

   I was happy, absolutely and utterly happy in my job at USF St.
   Pete at that time, but I also felt like I was languishing that
   same old same old. My job wasnt really changing, said van
   Beynen. I didnt have new challenges.

   Reading the book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by
   Carol Dweck triggered a new open-minded outlook for van Beynen
   to use with her work moving forward. She was recommended the
   book by former Associate Dean of the College of Education
   Olivia Hodges, whom she met during her time as an education
   liaison librarian at St. Pete.

   You know what, it was at that time, a little bit of an ugly
   reflective process that I thought about, where there were times
   where I did not have the most growth mindset. Where I could see
   You know, youre getting a little closed off  And I
   reflected on that a lot, said van Beynen.

   I actually printed up [a] little quick diagram and have it
   pinned in my office, just to remind me to catch myself from not
   being too reactive, to keep an open head, to keep an open mind,
   to reflect.

   Day in and day out, van Beynen brings that open mindset to her
   work, according to Assistant Director of Research and
   Instruction at the St. Pete library Theresa Burress. She
   described van Beynen as a visionary in helping shape research
   at USFs libraries.

   I love working with her because I feel like we have
   complementary skill sets and shes very good at [helping me] if
   Im working on a research manuscript that I want to send out
   for peer review, said Burress.

   I ask her to look at it and shes really talented at pulling
   out the findings that would be most significant for the
   profession. Shes good at shaping research narratives.

   Van Beynens natural leadership skills became immediately
   apparent to Cardwell when they started working together in
   2016. Throughout her time as a librarian at USF, shes remained
   attentive in supporting those who work with her while keeping a
   caring touch.

   I think shes a natural leader too, she thinks a lot about how
   to be effective and how to be compassionate, said Cardwell.

   Van Beynens leadership skills were put to the test once the
   university began the road toward consolidation, which is a
   highlight of her time at USFs libraries so far, especially
   under the virtual conditions posed by the pandemic.

   Librarians from all three campuses created workshops through
   Canvas that faculty members could use in their courses for
   extra credit or to facilitate discussion in classes. Moving
   forward, van Beynen wants to see that kind of inquiry and
   learning be generated through USF supporting faculty and
   student research.

   USF wants to increase its research, productivity, capacity and
   visibility, she said. All of the subject librarians have a
   role in that, were working with faculty to help them with
   their research questions, whether its finding content or not,
   theyre helping them increase their visibility, finding out
   about whats open access or how they can make their materials
   open access.

   When she goes to work, although now virtually, van Beynens
   biggest passion is a day of unrestricted possibilities when it
   comes to subject matter and learning.

   Theres a joke among geographers that they are jack of all
   trades and master of none. Because if you look at geographers,
   theres human geography, theres physical geography. Do they
   study people? Do they study places? Do they study the
   environment? They do all of these things. I actually liked that
   about librarianship, said van Beynen.

   I can go in the same day, helping a faculty member with
   something that pertains to childrens literature, multicultural
   childrens literature, to helping someone dealing with the
   field work and specimens that they collect in field work and
   how they are going to organize that. You really can get a range
   of questions.",,,0.997063398,0.0,,"Kaya van Beynen, associate dean library research instruction St. Pete campus, dedicated career facilitating research guiding others passions library sciences education.

Data from the Bureau of Meteorology suggests north Brisbane's climate is getting warmer.

The warmest March night typically reaches about 24 degrees - one degree warmer than 50 years ago.

One degree may not sound like much, but small changes in the climate have a big impact on our planet.

Warming trends are linked to sea level rise and extreme weather events.

Did you know?

The Bramble Cay melomy was a tiny species of rodent only found on a small sand island at the northern tip of the Great Barrier Reef - but it hasn't been sighted since 2009.

It was the first mammal to be declared extinct due to the impacts of climate change.

It's thought that rising sea levels and severe storms wiped out large areas of their habitat.

Tyron Roberts has lived in Brisbane's CBD for three decades.

""I feel that autumn and spring are warmer than usual, and we end up having some days that feel like the middle of summer,"" he said.

""Summer feels like it has begun moving into autumn now, it is staying hotter for longer.

""The grass hasn't been very nice at our local park recently and some creeks have dried up completely.

""It's probably made it harder for local sporting groups to try and deal with the heat.""

   offices on 8 March, and at FedEx, in honour of the annual
   occasion, its branches in APAC, the Middle East, and Africa
   (AMEA) are hosting a series of activities throughout the entire
   week.

   On Monday, led by FedEx's regional diversity, equity and
   inclusion committee's gender pillar leads, over 800 employees
   across the regions gathered together in an online story sharing
   event.
   FedEx's president (AMEA) Kawal Preet represented the region to
   take part in the company symposium called 'Educate. Empower.
   Enlighten.' to discuss various D&I issues with top female
   talents and leaders at different branches.

   ""Women empowerment is not about prohibiting male participation
   as we need both men and women acting in solidarity to achieve
   gender equality. So, well be having our male colleagues
   showing their support on the virtual stage this year as well,""
   Preet told Human Resources Online.

   For the rest of the week, employees were invited to post
   #ChoosetoChallenge themed pictures, videos and stories on
   FedEx's digital noticeboard where the company would select the
   highlights and share activity ideas such as best movies to
   watch by female directors. Additionally, activities were also
   planned at the local level.

   Preet said FedEx is a workplace where ""women in leadership is a
   norm, not an exception"", even though the nature of the industry
   tends to be male-dominated. The company debuted the Diversity,

   of DE&I in the region, and its efforts in D&I was recognised
   internationally. Nevertheless, Preet stressed that ""equity and
   inclusion is a continuous journey"", so they will continue to
   challenge themselves and look for growth.

   ""My own journey through the organisation has strengthened my
   focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, and as a female
   leader, I am devoted to drive change wherever needed and there
   is always opportunity to do more and do better,"" she said.

   On a personal note, in response to the International Women's
   Day theme, she wants to challenge the world to look into
   women's career amid the pandemic.

   ""A real passion point for me right now is the impact of the
   Covid-19 pandemic on women's careers. Women have been
   disproportionately affected and the economic fallout from
   Covid-19 is exacerbating inequality like never before,"" she
   said.

   ""We can connect women to programmes and policies that empower
   the next generation of entrepreneurs, helping them access new
   markets and grow. We can also support women-led firms by
   identifying and implementing the best solutions so they can
   compete in home markets and in cross-border e-commerce.""

   When asked about her advice to fellow females, she looked back
   at her career and revealed that she was once in a tug-of-war
   battle between a position that she longed for and her family.

   ""I personally struggled in the self-doubt trap when one of my
   biggest career opportunities was presented to me. At that
   moment, I was in Singapore and finally decided to put my hand
   up and interview for the job  and I got it. Making the very
   difficult decision to move from Singapore to Hong Kong with a
   two-year-old in tow to take on a very challenging role and
   raising my son with no family or friends to support was
   anything but easy,"" she said.

   ""That said, it may have been the smartest decision I made in my
   career, and one that eventually led me to my current position.
   I encourage all younger women to focus on a growth mindset. You
   can achieve whatever you put your mind to,"" she added.

   Continuing, she shared a quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt: A
   smooth sea never made a skilled sailor., meaning taking the
   easy way can never make anyone a better person.

   She urged every woman to step out of their comfort zone, take
   risks and pursue dreams that others may consider impossible.

Biden hosted the chief executives of pharmaceutical companies Merck and Johnson & Johnson at the White House on Wednesday to celebrate their pact to boost the supply of the coronavirus vaccine. Biden announced that his administration is seeking to secure an additional 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson.

Heres what to know:

The Senate confirmed Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Merrick Garland as attorney general. Later, the Senate voted to confirm Michael Regan to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Biden has picked 58 nominees to fill key roles in his administration so far. We are tracking 790 government positions that require Senate confirmation.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has approved a request from the Capitol Police to extend the deployment of National Guard members to protect Congress into May.
Bidens orders to rein in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement led to a sharp drop in arrests by the agency last month, even though a federal judge in Texas has blocked the new administrations 100-day pause on deportations.
Geraldo Rivera says hes considering U.S. Senate run in OhioReturn to menu

Geraldo Rivera, the former daytime talk show host turned conservative news commentator, tweeted that hes pondering a run for the U.S. Senate seat in Ohio currently held by retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman.

Rivera, a friend of former president Donald Trump, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Wednesday that he planned to go on a listening tour of the state before officially deciding whether to get in the race. Although Rivera has defended Trump in his role as a pundit on Fox News, he also has been critical of the former presidents behavior after the 2020 election.

Hes been a friend of mine forever. I have been very public in my disapproval of his actions post-election and certainly condemn in the most vigorous way what happened on Jan. 6, Rivera told the newspaper. However, I think President Trump is not only redeemable, but hes a force of nature who has been a lifelong friend in my adult life. I would expect he would approve of this. We can resolve our issues and help heal the Republican Party.

Rivera, a native New Yorker who has a home in Ohio, said hed be a Republican who would scare the bejesus out of the Democrats and the far-right wing of the Republican Party.

An hour before tweeting his interest in the Ohio seat, Rivera tweeted about the coronavirus relief bill, writing, Doesnt fact Democrats were able to pass one of the largest spending bills in the history of the Republic with zero GOP support make you queasy?

The GOP primary in the Ohio Senate race is expected to be a crowded and contentious one. If he were to run, Rivera, who has been a fixture on television for decades, would have the early advantage of his celebrity.

GOP senators introduce full repeal of the estate taxReturn to menu
By Colby Itkowitz8:05 p.m.
Link copied
Republican Senate leaders who voted against the $1.9 trillion covid relief bill introduced legislation to repeal the tax paid on estates worth more than $11.7 million for an individual or double that, $23.4 million, after they die.

Getting rid of the estate tax altogether has long been a GOP priority, and in 2018 under President Donald Trump, the threshold for paying the tax was doubled to more than $11 million and indexed for inflation. The Biden administration and Democrats have proposed lowering it back to pre-Trump levels.

The legislation, which has no chance of becoming law with a Democratic House, Senate and White House, is sponsored by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and is co-sponsored by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and 24 other Senate Republicans.

The effort to eliminate the tax, which is only paid on the amount that exceeds the $11.7 million threshold and applies to only a few thousand people a year, comes as Republicans fought to lower the income level for those to qualify for the $1,400 direct stimulus payment in the covid relief bill.

Amtrak will restore daily long-distance train service with federal relief fundsReturn to menu

Daily service will be restored to long-distance Amtrak trains starting in May and hundreds of furloughed workers will be called to report back to work as early as next month, the passenger railroad announced Wednesday after Congress passed a pandemic relief package that includes $1.7 billion for the carrier.

Amtrak ended daily service last year to hundreds of stations outside the Northeast as part of cost-saving measures that followed a precipitous drop in ridership and revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic. Most long-distance Amtrak trains have been operating three times a week since October.

The company said it will begin to notify more than 1,200 furloughed employees this month that they will be asked report to work as early as April.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) was among the members of Congress who voted against the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.

But on Wednesday, after the House passed the measure, Wicker was singing the praises of at least part of it.

Independent restaurant operators have won $28.6 billion worth of targeted relief, Wicker said in a tweet. This funding will ensure small businesses can survive the pandemic by helping to adapt their operations and keep their employees on the payroll.

He included a link to an article outlining the ways the relief package will benefit the restaurant industry.

Phillip Waller, Wickers communications director, noted that Wicker is among the authors of the Restaurants Act, which would establish a $120 billion relief fund to support independent establishments. He also pointed out that Wicker co-authored an amendment with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) that included the restaurant relief fund in the coronavirus relief package that passed the Senate.

Wicker has supported targeted relief for restaurants from the very beginning, Waller said. But ultimately, the senator did not agree with the shape of the relief package as a whole.

He was not able to support $2 trillion in poorly targeted spending as was proposed by congressional Democrats, Waller said. He will continue working to advance targeted relief for restaurants and other groups that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

How dare you: Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett slams GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman over Black Lives Matter commentsReturn to menu

Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.) went off on Republican Rep. Glenn Grothman (Wis.) during a floor speech after he said the Black Lives Matter movement doesnt like old-fashioned family.

How dare you, how dare you say that Black Lives Matter, Black people do not understand old-fashioned families, she said. How dare you say that we are not interested in families in the Black community. That is outrageous; that should be stricken down.

Grothman had said an increased tax credit for single people in the covid relief bill led to a marriage penalty and tied it to his accusation that Black Lives Matter activists dont support traditional families.

I bring it up because I know the strength that Black Lives Matter had in this last election, I know its a group that doesnt like the old-fashioned family, he said.

Asked to clarify what he meant, Grothmans spokesman, Timothy Svoboda, said his boss was referring to Black Lives Matter as a group and not all Black people. He pointed to a Washington Examiner article from the fall about the official Black Lives Matter Global Network removing a page from its website with a description of what the group believed that included: We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.

The longer description focuses on the groups efforts of inclusivity, including that it endeavors to make its spaces family-friendly and enable parents to fully participate with their children. We dismantle the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work double shifts so that they can mother in private even as they participate in public justice work.

An archive of that page can be read here.

Plaskett received applause from her Democratic colleagues in the House chamber when she finished.

American Airlines tells employees to be sure to thank members of Congress for passing relief bill, even though all Republicans voted noReturn to menu

Executives at American Airlines on Wednesday urged the companys employees to thank members of Congress for passing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan  even though every Republican lawmaker voted against it.

In a memo to staff members, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said the additional funding for the Payroll Support Program contained in the bill means that for our 13,000 colleagues who received Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notices last month, those are happily canceled  you can tear them up!

If you see your local Congressional representative on a flight, be sure to thank her or him for their work this past year and for recognizing the noble work you all do every day, Parker and Isom said in the letter. We will need more time until vaccines are out in full force for demand for travel to significantly improve, but thanks to the extension of the PSP, our country and world can count on American Airlines to be ready.

American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, and its headquarters sits in Texass 24th Congressional District. The district is represented in Congress by Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R), who voted against the relief package Wednesday.

Biden to travel to Delaware County, Pa., next week as he looks to promote coronavirus relief packageReturn to menu
By Donna Cassata5:17 p.m.

President Biden will travel to Delaware County in Pennsylvania next week in his first visit to his native state since he won the presidency. The trip to the Philadelphia suburbs Tuesday will come as the administration looks to promote the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that the House passed Wednesday.

I want to thank Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and the House of Representatives today for passing the bill that I will be signing into law shortly, Biden said Wednesday afternoon. This bill represents a historic, historic victory for the American people. I look forward to signing it later this week. Everything in the American Rescue Plan addresses a real need.

Biden will deliver a prime-time address Thursday as part of the administrations effort to sell the package, which he is scheduled to sign into law Friday. In hindsight, some Democrats have said President Barack Obama did not do enough to promote the 2009 rescue package that helped reverse the financial crisis.

We didnt adequately explain what we had done. Barack was so modest, he didnt want to take, as he said, a victory lap, Biden, who was Obamas vice president, said last week. I kept saying, Tell people what we did. He said: We dont have time. Im not going to take a victory lap. And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.

Pennsylvania is familiar territory for the Scranton-born Biden, whose win in the state in November helped deliver the presidency.

McCarthy asks Pelosi about easing Capitol covid restrictionsReturn to menu
By Colby Itkowitz5:11 p.m.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asking her to detail her plans to reopen the Peoples House, citing new guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that ease some covid restrictions for vaccinated Americans.

McCarthy suggests that Pelosi begin lifting the protocols put in place nearly a year ago in the House because about 75 percent of the chambers members are vaccinated.

That recommendation doesnt take into account the many other people who work in the Capitol, including congressional aides, janitors, law enforcement personnel and reporters, who may not yet be vaccinated. It also overstates the new CDC guidelines. The CDC said a vaccinated person could be inside maskless with an unvaccinated person in a single household but did not suggest that hundreds of vaccinated people could gather with dozens of unvaccinated ones.

McCarthy specifically asks Pelosi for the timeline for ending proxy voting  something several Republicans took advantage of when they attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida recently.

He also asks when lawmakers will return to in-person committee meetings, when visitors will be allowed inside the Capitol and when mask requirements will be lifted.

McCarthy then asks about removing the security reinforcements that have been in place around the Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection, saying, There are no credible threats against the Capitol. The House adjourned a day early last week after U.S. Capitol Police received intelligence of threats against the Capitol.

Simply put: its time that we return to regular order. House Republicans are eager for the chance to reopen the Peoples House, restore Americas voice in Congress, and work day in and day out to address the many concerns our constituents face, he concluded.

At an event with the chief executives of Johnson & Johnson and Merck on Wednesday, Biden hailed the progress the United States has made toward combating the coronavirus and said that any surplus vaccine doses will be shared with other countries after people living in the United States get them.

If we have a surplus, were going to share it with the rest of the world.  Were not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe, Biden told reporters at the White House. And so were going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first, but were then going to try to help the rest of the world.

Biden also thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for shepherding the coronavirus relief package through the House hours earlier. Everything in the plan addresses a real need, he said.

The vaccines bring hope and healing in so many ways, Biden said. Again, a vaccinated American is the only way to beat the pandemic, get our economy back on track and for us to get back our lives and our loved ones.

Top Senate Republican says Capitol fencing is way overreacting to actual threats Return to menu

The Senates top Republican slammed the continued presence of fencing and National Guard around the Capitol, complaining that Congress is way overreacting to the current need for security.

I think weve overdone it, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said, noting there are presently no serious threats against the Capitol.

Since shortly after the Jan. 6 riot, the Capitol campus has been surrounded with rings of unscalable fencing and round-the-clock patrols of Capitol Police officers and armed National Guard troops. But in recent weeks, the continued presence of those security measures has sparked heated disputes between leading Democrats and Republicans over whether the Capitol is being overly fortified.

Republicans have been vocal about their disdain for the fortress around the Capitol, as many have taken to calling it. On Wednesday, McConnell said all this razor wire around the complex  reminds me of my last visit to Kabul.

Many Democrats are also frustrated that the Capitol grounds have been closed off to the public. But in comparison to the GOP, the party has kept its criticism largely in check, in deference to an ongoing security review House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had commissioned.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré briefed members on the results of that review earlier this week. Among his recommendations are a proposal to install movable and retractable fencing around the Capitol and to give the chief of an expanded Capitol Police force the ability to call in the National Guard without seeking permission from superiors.

Do we need some changes? We probably do, McConnell acknowledged Wednesday. But I think we are continuing to overreact based on current threat levels to what is needed here at the Capitol.

Senate confirms Merrick Garland to be nations attorney generalReturn to menu
By Matt Zapotosky2:53 p.m.

Merrick Garland, a longtime federal appeals court judge whose nomination to the Supreme Court Republicans famously refused to consider, was confirmed as Bidens attorney general Wednesday.

Senators voted 70 to 30 to approve Garlands nomination. He will take over a Justice Department that saw its reputation battered as President Donald Trump sought to use its power to benefit his friends and hurt his enemies, and which is overseeing several high-profile cases that could be politically perilous.

As a judge, Garland earned a reputation as a moderate consensus builder, and Biden selected him because he was viewed as someone who could restore the Justice Departments credibility and independence from the White House on criminal matters. He enjoyed bipartisan support. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said before the vote that Garland had a long reputation as a straight-shooter and legal expert and that his left-leaning views were within the legal mainstream.

Garland has vowed to make decisions on criminal matters without regard to politics and that the agency on his watch will be dedicated to fighting discrimination and domestic terrorism. He has said his first briefing will focus on the investigation into Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol  a sprawling, nationwide case that already has produced charges against roughly 300 people.

House panel takes step toward reviewing results in contested Iowa raceReturn to menu
By Felicia Sonmez2:52 p.m.

A key House committee took its first step Wednesday toward reviewing the results of Novembers election in Iowas 2nd Congressional District after Democratic candidate Rita Hart officially petitioned the chamber in December to overturn the contest she lost by six votes to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks.

At a virtual meeting, the Committee on House Administration voted to postpone a decision on Rep. Miller-Meekss motion to dismiss Harts petition until it has had a chance to examine the details of the case.

Today none of us can say with confidence who won this election, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the panels chair, said during the meeting, adding, Our answer must be grounded in hard evidence, not bald assumptions.

In a filing to the House in December, Marc Elias, an attorney for Hart, said state and county election officials in Iowa made two sets of errors that marred the certified vote total.

Republicans have argued that Hart should have opted to make her challenge through Iowas courts, rather than choosing to pursue a partisan process in the House, as Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois, the top Republican on the Administration Committee, said during Wednesdays hearing.

By moving forward with Rita Harts complaint, this committee is calling into question every member of Congress elected under Iowa law and, frankly, each of us, too, Davis said. Rita Hart had an opportunity to challenge the claims she is making before the committee in Iowas impartial court process. She chose not to. That leads me to believe her lawyers knew that she could not win under Iowa law.

Miller-Meeks was seated in January along with the rest of the 117th Congress. But a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the move was provisional pending the results of the committees review.

In a statement after Wednesdays vote, Zach Meunier, Harts campaign manager, praised the move.

At least 22 Iowans legally-cast ballots still have not been counted due to a string of errors, Meunier said. We are glad to see the House Committee on Administration taking the next step toward ensuring that every legally-cast vote is counted in this race and that all Iowans voices are heard.

Miller-Meekss campaign attorney, meanwhile, dismissed Wednesdays move as merely a procedural vote and said the congresswoman remains focused on serving the needs of her constituents.

Rita Harts contest has no more merit today than it did when it was filed, the attorney, Alan Ostergren, said in a statement. Her refusal to put her claims before neutral judges in Iowa tells us everything we need to know about the weakness of her case.  Harts power quest is wrong and damages our electoral system.

Rep. Jared Golden (Maine), the lone Democrat to oppose the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, said in a statement Wednesday that he did not support some of the changes made by the Senate to the bill.

Golden voted against the package last month as well, before it was taken up by the Senate.

Although I support the Senates effort to reduce the number of wealthier households that will receive stimulus checks, they did not go far enough, and other changes  like removing the minimum wage increase or providing a lower unemployment benefit  undermined policies that I support, Golden said in a statement Wednesday. I voted for a $15 minimum wage in the last Congress, and given the opportunity, I intend to do so again.

Golden said his no vote should not be construed as an unwillingness to support my constituents and the economy through this pandemic. And he argued that the borrowing and spending that will be brought about by the relief package poses a risk to both our economic recovery and the priorities I would like to work with the Biden Administration to achieve, like rebuilding our nations infrastructure and fixing our broken and unaffordable healthcare system.

To expand coverage and help with lowering health care premiums. To give small businesses what they need to stay open. To expand unemployment insurance, provide food and nutrition assistance. To help keep a roof over peoples heads. To cut child poverty in half.

This legislation is about giving the backbone of this nation  the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going  a fighting chance, Biden said.

He called Pelosi the finest and most capable speaker in the history of our nation.

Bill Gates has written a remarkable book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need (2021): it cuts through the smog and tells us how technology can help overcome the climate crisis.

It is a succinct summary of climate science (chapters 4 to 8) that segues into offering a suite of interventions and solutions (chapters 9 to 12) that are sure to be a primer for investors and institutions. The generous advance praise and blurbs on the cover, and a phalanx of experts and reviewers in the acknowledgement, assure you that this is all you will ever need to know about climate change and how we can take care of it hereon.

What I enjoyed about the book is the optimism and aplomb with which Gates single-handedly charts a clear roadmap for everyone to adopt. But his tone is deferential and a lesson in humility for billionaires, providing details about how the Gates family and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have advanced discussions on various fronts of public health and development, and now climate. I admire his willingness to wager on tech that can be a game-changer (like investing and being sporting about losing $50 million with a company that promised to convert tree biomass into ethanol). He is aware of the risks and rewards of adopting nuclear energy, geo-engineering and new technologies on the horizon.

But I also have several points of departure from the prescription that Gates offers. There are vital pieces missing in his narrative â the most important one being that his climate equation is devoid of nature, its processes, the diverse ecosystems and their lifeforms and myriad communities that depend deeply on each other for their survival. In fact, in the entire book, the word ânatureâ appears only once.

Anyone who understands natureâs processes knows that soils, mud, detritus, mulch, sand, gravel, grit and rock are crucial pieces in the climate change story, as are ocean currents, wind circulation, shapes and size of landmasses and, of course, lifeforms â especially microbes, the principal primary energy producers on Earth and which regulate the bulk of Earthâs carbon-oxygen cycle. When these small pieces come together, they drive Earthâs engine.

Over billions of years, the uplift of continents and the exposure, submergence and melting of rocks has created a flux of minerals and elements. This engine is an enormous, planetary-scale, biogeochemical reactor â but it starts from small things. Two elements in particular â carbon and silicon â are very important. They are among the most abundant and versatile, and they form minerals easily with one another. When they work in tandem, their combined power is immense. We see this play out when rain falls over young Himalayan granite, etching out reactive silica that binds with the carbon dioxide trapped in the drops of rain. It is carried into streams and becomes a mighty river, where the carbon dioxide sinks and is buried in a maze of submarine canyons in the Bay of Bengal. Some scientists consider the Ganga to be the most efficient at burying carbon among all landscapes and features on Earth.

At the bottom of the seas, Earthâs other geological features, like volcanic lava and roiling magma, also transform carbonate rocks back into silicates, and there are tiny shelly creatures that bring these back to the surface. Landscape, lifeforms and geological processes have a large part to play in the carbon (and other mineral) cycle. Even if these processes literally take place at a geological pace, the scale is so massive that it is still enough to heal the planet.

In a more profound and immediate way, billions of interdependent microbes and plants in soil and water fix carbon in its organic form. Much of this gets buried in the depths of the oceans for tens of thousands of years, or for hundreds of years in the soil if left undisturbed. A small fraction re-enters the atmosphere as gases or leaches into the substratum to form minerals.

Nature can take a few seasons to capture and store carbon, as plants grow and die and soil microbes accumulate their organic material. It can also take centuries as trees in forests gather girth, or millions of years if geological processes like the one mentioned above play out. But natural decomposition or worse, a forest fire, can decimate both centuries-old forests and young grasses that sprung up a few days ago. No matter how much carbon we trap on the surface by simply planting trees, it is still at risk of being released into the atmosphere.

Instead, we need to follow the path of fossil fuels that got made over millions of years. Billions of tonnes of organic plant matter got buried under layers of sediments and rock, and got cooked in intense heat and pressure. They remain buried under layers of rock. Only if they are deliberately extracted and burnt for energy do they release greenhouse gases. We must therefore bury and lock the excess carbon under layers of rocks or deep sea sediments.

The key to finding a sustainable solution for climate change lies with deep carbon burial â a point that Gatesâs book misses completely. Should we then wait for geological processes to play out or forests to regenerate? Not at all. We can develop a host of intermediate and hybrid technologies to capture and lock carbon safely for thousands of years or more. Such technological interventions must mimic natureâs processes or plug into natural processes and speed them up â not work against them.

Using nature-mimicking technologies (instead of just direct air-capture or point-capture, as Gates proposes to harvest carbon) can help restore ecosystems, and revive our obliterated ponds, lakes, rivers, wetlands and oceans. By ignoring biological and geological principles, the intricacies of the carbon cycle and how it is intermeshed with other element cycles, and the role of organisms and plants, we would create a synthetic world â a world bereft of the magic of nature and life.

Gatesâs book only mentions âecosystemâ five times in the context of water security, and mentions âdeforestationâ largely in the context of agriculture. Gates says ârestoring ecosystems has a huge payoffâ for urban water security. He continues: âPlanting mangroves is much cheaper than building breakwaters, and the trees also improve the water quality. Theyâre a great investment.â You are spot on, Mr Gates, but the right term is ârewildingâ, not âplantingâ.

Sadly, this lack of consideration is reflected in Gatesâs own investments, like Coca Cola â a corporation that has for a long time been accused of over-extracting groundwater and contributing greatly to plastic pollution. So his investments not only defeat his thesis on conserving water but are also detrimental to his Foundationâs commitment to fighting non-communicable diseases.

The data in the book is reminiscent of the late Hans Roslingâs elegant style of breaking down complex datasets. But some tables and figures are also oversimplified; they will benefit by including the ranges and means.

In chapter 12, Gates prescribes what consumers need to do; some bits read like tobacco industry memos: you are responsible for the moral choices you make and the consequences you face. One could argue that, unlike the COVAX alliance for COVID-19, governments and markets have failed to incentivise an advanced market commitment for existing proven technologies for reducing carbon emissions (for example for the global replacement of incandescent bulbs with LEDs). He cursorily dismisses the role of divesting because they have limited effect â though Gates did divest his direct holding from oil and gas.

Gates invests $5 million a year to mitigate his familyâs carbon footprint. If all things are equal â wealth, access, carbon footprint â a Volkswagen driver would be doing enough simply by protecting one neighbourhood tree. Equity and rights are not the strong points of Gatesâs thesis. Putting a price on everything so permeates our lives that we barely notice the free, life-giving services of nature anymore. Gates laments that farmers in developing countries like India need to adopt tractors and new technologies to feed billions. But if Jawaharlal Nehru and Mao Zedong had mechanised their countryâs agriculture in the 1940s and 1950s, the climate crisis would have been at our doorsteps far sooner â perhaps even before we might have known what caused it, and we would have been even less prepared than we are now.

The fundamental premise of the book, that we need to reach net-zero emissions using a portfolio of technofixes, is also a bit misleading. We need to adopt strategies to become significantly net-negative because we also need to harvest our historical carbon dioxide emissions and prepare a buffer for future climate shocks. (Gates wisely mentions unexpected methane release and volcanism.) This moment in history is an opportunity to repair ecosystems, and I was hoping to find a mention of the link between the damage to ecosystems and the emergence of COVID-19 in the bookâs afterword, âClimate Change and COVID-19â, but it is missing.

The climate crisis is not a single problem â that of greenhouse gas emissions alone â but a multifaceted one that we need to address on multiple fronts. Some are known and visible (the weakening of major ocean currents, collapsing ice shelfs, fires in the Arctic) and others which barely find a mention (depleting soil productivity, acidification of oceans). There can be no single fix for climate change.

To mend it, we need to involve the more than four billion citizens (or 52% of the worldâs population) of our planet comprising indigenous people, forest dwellers, subsistence farmers, pastoralists and fisher folk who depend on nature for their livelihoods. Gates recognises that billions of people are prone to climate shocks but fails to tell the reader of how the challenge of climate refugees who arrive into cities or cross borders will be mitigated. As we march on with our daily lives, we are pushing more and more people to the brink: for more lithium to run electric vehicles, we are destroying lands and the water of indigenous people in Peru; for the coltan which powers our mobile phones, we have driven local communities in the Congo to near slavery and their forests to ruins.

Perhaps this can be the moment to call for a debate on the moral question of who decides what the future strategies for the planet should be. Science can provide answers only if we are willing to understand its several perspectives. Objective science, inclusive of all disciplines, must demarcate the negotiables from the non-negotiables as we chart our future course. Economic opportunities that arise for future markets must not only serve a few private beneficiaries but must be distributed as a global public good.

It is only through public debate that every nation and its people can become more aware of the price we pay for living in a society where everything is up for sale. This book was a bestseller even before it reached the stands, as it should be, but I would urge Mr Gates to include a note for nature and its services in the next edition. If we choose to ignore nature, we will do so at the cost of our very existence.

And he's more powerful and hated than ever.

(Image: AAP/Jason Reed)

After working for 68 years straight as the CEO and chair of public companies, you would expect Rupert Murdochâs 90th birthday to be a big thing.

The only comparable contemporary act of uninterrupted institutional leadership is the Queen, who turns 95 next month after ascending to the throne in February 1952.

Given recent events, maybe Rupert and the Queen should call a joint press conference and retire together to let their squabbling families sort out their differences.

Rupert returned from Oxford in 1953 to take the reins of publicly listed News Ltd after his father Keith Murdochâs shock death in October the previous year. Professionally, he has never been anything but a public company CEO. Since 1990 he has also insisted on being chairman of the board, whether it was News Corp, BSkyB, 21st Century Fox or Fox Corp.

A fanatical control freak, Rupert is a trust fund kid who has never had to take orders in a work place.

Rupert was born in Melbourne on this day in 1931 and shows no sign of slowing down. Indeed, eldest son and heir apparent Lachlan Murdoch famously told Michael Wolff in 2008: âDonât you know, my dadâs never going to die?â

Like former Cabcharge CEO Reg Kermode, there is every chance Rupert will die in office rather than resign or retire ahead of time.

There has been a smattering of pieces about Rupertâs milestone birthday and the following are recommended reading: Chris Warren in Crikey; The Guardian, The Economist, and The New York Times.

However, as usual, Rupert media outlets that he controls are not allowed to independently cover such an event unless he approves. He doesnât want anyone talking about his age, so even his Australian corporate fawner-in-chief Terry McCrann is yet comment on the milestone.

The only AGM where Rupert and I engaged on the age question was this exchange in New York back in 2010:

Question: âYouâre turning 80 next March. Youâre the worldâs longest-serving CEO â 57 years in the chair.â



Rupert Murdoch: âI donât think so.â



Question: âDo you know whoâs served longer at a public company?â



Rupert Murdoch: âI donât know â Iâm sure there has beenâ¦â



Question: âWhat are the plans when you turn 80? No possible intentions of slowing down at all?â



Rupert Murdoch: âNo. When my health gives out, I will get out of the way and not before unless the board decides to remove me, but that is another matter.â

Rupert was indeed the worldâs longest-serving public company CEO 10 years ago and even more more so today. The nearest rival is Warren Buffett, 90, who became executive chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in 1970 at the age of 39.

Whilst his outrageous annual pay packet hasnât diminished, Rupert has been making fewer public appearances in recent years. He rarely attends the Fox or News Corp quarterly conference calls. Rupertâs last public utterance was when he was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the peculiar, London-based Australia Day Foundation on January 26 and released a brief video slamming what he described as âawful woke orthodoxyâ.

This was another green light to his various global cultural warriors arguing against climate change action, gender equality, racial justice and various other so-called âwokeâ issues which powerful and entitled white men like Rupert feel threatened by.

According to SMH gossip columnist Andrew Hornery, Rupert is spending his 90th birthday at his California home but a big family celebration is planned for later in the year when flying restrictions are lifted.

But where is his all-staff email, an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal or the birthday interview on Fox News?

Contrast Rupertâs birthday silence with the extraordinary fanfare surrounding The Australianâs 50th birthday in 2014, or Rupertâs attendance as guest-of-honour at the IPAâs 70th birthday in 2013, where he was lauded by Tony Abbott.

Despite his age, Rupert Murdoch has never been bigger, richer, more powerful or more hated â so much so that his two biggest US media enemies, CNN and The New York Times, are teaming up to produce a six-part documentary on him that will air some time in 2021-22.

I spent two hours being interviewed by CNNâs documentary makers a couple of weeks ago and have never seen such a professional TV operation in action.

Rather than third parties talking about Rupert, he really should sit down and pen an autobiography about his extraordinary career inheriting one afternoon newspaper in sleepy Adelaide and building an unprecedented media empire which has seen him emerge as leader of arguably the worldâs most powerful family, amassing a tidy $30 billion pile along the way.

Itâs just such a shame that this notorious former Australian citizen has done more damage than good, unethically debauching journalism, warmongering, denying climate change, pulling Britain out of the EU and backing destructive demagogues like Donald Trump.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) â Israelâs leaders Monday celebrated the countryâs 5 millionth coronavirus vaccination on the same day the government began vaccinating Palestinian laborers who work in the country. The time lag has drawn international criticism and highlighted global disparities.

There was no indication the two events were coordinated, but their split-screen quality offered a stark contrast between Israelâs world-leading vaccination blitz and the plight of 5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Progress in places like Israel, the United States and Britain has heightened concerns among human rights advocates of driving a wider gap between wealthy countries and those that canât afford pricey vaccination programs.

Until Monday, the Palestinian Authority, which administers autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, had received enough doses for only 6,000 people.

Israel has inoculated more than half its population of 9.3 million and pushed ahead Monday with the reopening of more of its economy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing re-election this month, promised to vaccinate the entire adult population by the end of April, which he said would mean âwe are out of the corona crisis.â

He appeared at a press conference in Tel Aviv with Janet Lavi-Azulay, an Israeli woman who became the 5 millionth person in Israel to be vaccinated. In all, Israel has vaccinated roughly 80% of its adult population, giving decision makers enough confidence to begin reopening stores, restaurants, health clubs and music clubs in recent days. Many of these amenities are available only to those who can prove they have been vaccinated or have recovered from the virus.

About 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast, Anwar Muhammad Awarin got his jab and showed a text on his cell phone certifying the inoculation. For him and other Palestinian workers, it was less about celebrating and more about survival.

âI got the vaccine so I can work,â said Awarin, who received his inoculation at the Meitar checkpoint in the West Bank. âIf you donât get the vaccine, you donât get the permit. So, I got the permit and my health as well.â

According to COGAT, the Israeli defense agency that orchestrated the vaccine campaign, the workers are not required to be vaccinated in order to keep their entry permits at the current time. But many laborers said their Israeli employers have pressured them to be vaccinated, and there were widespread concerns they could lose their jobs if they do not get inoculated.

Awarin was one of some 6,000 Palestinian laborers who received their first doses of the Moderna vaccine from paramedics from the Israeli rescue service Magen David Adom.

The vaccination drive was postponed by one day. More vaccination sites for Palestinian workers were expected to open this week.

About 100,000 Palestinian laborers from the West Bank work in Israel and its settlements, which are widely seen internationally as illegal and an obstacle to peace.

Maj. Gen. Kamil Abu Rukun, the head of COGAT, said in a statement that Israelis and Palestinians âlive in the same epidemiological spaceâ and that it was a shared interest to vaccinate Palestinians.

Israel has won international plaudits for moving quickly to vaccinate its population. But it has come under criticism from U.N. officials, human rights groups and medical experts for not sharing more of its stockpile with the Palestinians.

Human rights groups and many Palestinians say that as an occupying power, Israel is responsible for providing vaccines to the Palestinians. Israel says that under interim peace accords reached in the 1990s, it does not have any such obligation.

Israeli officials have said the priority is vaccinating Israelâs own population first, while the Palestinian Authority has said it will obtain its own vaccines through the World Health Organization and other sources. Israel has vaccinated its own Arab population.

To date, the PA has acquired enough vaccine doses for only 6,000 people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are home to nearly 5 million Palestinians. It received 2,000 doses from Israel and acquired another 10,000 doses of a Russian-made vaccine. Each person is given in two doses to be fully vaccinated.

Israel has administered over 8.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to its population of 9.3 million. Over 3.7 million Israelis â more than 40% â have received both of the doses required for maximum immunity.

Netanyahu also announced plans to share surplus vaccines with far-flung allies in Africa, Europe and Latin America, but the decision has been frozen by legal questions. Last Thursday, Netanyahu met with leaders of Denmark and Austria and said the three nations would join forces in the fight against COVID-19 with an investment in research and roll-out of vaccines.

The draft highlights a speech Trump delivered to his supporters in Washington, D.C., shortly before they began rioting at the Capitol.

They are expected to introduce the articles of impeachment in a matter of days, possibly as soon as Monday, CNN and MSNBC said. Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland are reportedly taking the lead in drafting the document.

For the second time in his presidency, House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment against Donald Trump , after hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent riot on Wednesday, according to a draft obtained by multiple media outlets.

Latest draft of the articles of impeachment that will be formally introduced on Monday includes one article: âincitement of insurrection.â Reps. Cicilline, Lieu and Raskin are taking the lead pic.twitter.com/DUaVALWgzM

Trump has been facing calls for his impeachment since Wednesday, when a crowd of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers prepared to certify President-elect Joe Biden as the victor over Trump, who has been telling his followers for months now that the election was rigged and stolen from him.

The riot resulted in the deaths of four participants and one Capitol Police officer.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was among the first to put impeachment on the table, tweeting Wednesday that Congress âcanât allow him to remain in office, itâs a matter of preserving our Republic and we need to fulfill our oath.â

If the House follows through, this will be the first time in American history that a president has faced articles of impeachment twice. The House first impeached Trump in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, but the Republican-controlled Senate ultimately acquitted him.

Trump has less than two weeks left in office â something he acknowledged for the first time on Thursday following the certification of Electoral College votes, though he didnât go as far as to admit he legitimately lost the election.

White House spokesperson Judd Deere issued a statement slamming the House Democratsâ plans.
